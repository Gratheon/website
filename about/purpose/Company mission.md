# Harmonize humanity with nature

As humanity expands its technological horizons, building new types of spaceships and dreaming of distant planets,  we continue to grapple with wars, climate change, social inequality, and malnutrition. In these challenging times, we turn our attention to a small insect - the key to plant life reproduction. Caring after the bees 🐝 can teach us compassion and love.

Our mission is balancing human progress with the preservation of nature, aiming for sustainable development and the regeneration of Earth's ecosystems. By doing so, we aspire to maximize human happiness, awareness, responsibilities and efficiency.

[Culture and values](../company/Culture%20and%20values%20🫀/index.md) and [Symbolism](Symbolism.md) are reflecting this mission
