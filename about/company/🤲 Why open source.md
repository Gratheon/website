Many investors and mentors are surprised to see us open source. This page clarifies reasoning behind such decision.

1. Trust. Our customerts, beekeepers, trust hardware and software systems more if they know how their data is being processed and that they are not vendor-locked after purchasing a device and still have freedom.
2. Community of volunteers. We build and rely on open collaboration with volunteers and beekeepers to adopt software as a system and improve it further.
3. Hiring. By being transparent, new engineers can see our code before joining, reducing misundestanding.
4. Use of AGPL software. We use grafana and yolo models as an example of software that is free if we are also open source.
6. Culture. Our company value is to [Radiate truth 🌞](🫀%20Culture%20and%20values/Radiate%20truth%20🌞.md). Which means that not only code is open source, but also hardware, data and processes.
7. Our [Company mission](../🌻%20Purpose/Company%20mission.md) cannot be reached if we patent-protect our IP and disallow developing worlds from using it.

We are not the first company to have values. Our business model is based on SaaS data management fees while maintaining strong brand, not on selling hardware.
