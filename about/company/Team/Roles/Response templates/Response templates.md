If you’re reading this and thinking “what, a template? generic answers?”, then yes. 

We have dozen of volunteers that need a proper answer and unfortunately we can’t do a very personalized approach on the first contact. We can do it later in the “pipeline”, after 95% readers ignore us. Thats real life of hiring pipelines. Not all people read where they apply to. Not everyone studies the background and role requirements. This is a graceful way to accommodate human nature with some efficient automation.
