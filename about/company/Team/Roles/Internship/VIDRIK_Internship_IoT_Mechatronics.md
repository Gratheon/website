## Internship Opportunity: Build the Future of Beekeeping with Robotics & IoT @ Gratheon

## Are you passionate about technology, nature, and making a real-world impact? Do you want to apply your IoT and Mechatronics skills to help save the bees and revolutionize agriculture?

**Gratheon** is an early-stage startup based in Tallinn, Estonia, on a mission to harmonize humanity with nature. We are developing **open-source, open, modular robotic beehives** equipped with sensors, cameras, and automation to monitor colony health, improve beekeeping efficiency, and ensure precise pollination for global food security. We're tackling critical challenges like colony collapse, pest infestations (like Varroa mites), and the manual labor intensity of traditional beekeeping.

## The Internship Role

We are looking for enthusiastic and hands-on **IoT & Mechatronics Interns** to join our small, dedicated team. You will play a crucial role in the design, development, testing, and deployment of our robotic beehive systems.

## What You'll Do

*   **Develop & Integrate Sensors:** Work on selecting, integrating, and testing various sensors (temperature, humidity, acoustics, computer vision, weight, etc.) for monitoring beehive conditions and bee behavior.
*   **Robotics & Automation:** Participate in the design, prototyping, and implementation of robotic components (e.g., using stepper motors, controllers) and automation processes within the beehive.
*   **Hardware Prototyping:** Utilize CAD modeling (e.g., Onshape, Fusion360) and 3D printing for rapid prototyping of mechanical parts. Assist with assembly and testing of electronic components (experience with PCB design using KiCAD/Altium is a plus).
*   **System Testing & Field Trials:** Assist in setting up and conducting tests for our hardware prototypes, both in the lab and potentially in real apiary environments. Work with IoT devices like NVIDIA Jetson or similar platforms.
*   **Data Acquisition & Integration:** Help configure data pipelines from sensors and collaborate with software engineers to integrate hardware data into our platform.
*   **Firmware Development (Optional):** Depending on skills, contribute to firmware for microcontrollers (e.g., using C/C++, Python, Rust).
*   **Explore ROS (Optional):** Potential to work with the Robot Operating System (ROS) for more complex robotic tasks.

## What You'll Gain

*   Hands-on experience in a cutting-edge field combining IoT, Robotics, Mechatronics, Machine Learning, Agrotech, and AI.
*   Direct involvement in the full product development lifecycle in an early-stage startup environment.
*   Opportunity to contribute to a meaningful project with a positive environmental impact.
*   Mentorship from experienced engineers.
*   Experience working with real-world sensor data, physical systems, and automation challenges.

## Who We're Looking For

*   Currently pursuing or recently completed a degree in Mechatronics, Robotics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, or a related field with a strong focus on IoT/Embedded Systems.
*   Practical experience with sensors, microcontrollers (e.g., ESP32, Raspberry Pi, Jetson), and basic electronics.
*   Experience with CAD software and 3D printing for prototyping.
*   Familiarity with stepper motors, controllers, or other actuators is a plus.
*   Programming skills (e.g., C/C++, Python) for embedded systems are beneficial. Experience with Rust or Go is a bonus.
*   Problem-solving mindset and eagerness to learn and tackle new challenges.
*   Interest in sustainability, agriculture, or beekeeping is a plus!
*   Good communication skills in English.
