We think of product development as a hierarchy of abstractions:

## Use cases. 
These are main customer journeys that may involve multiple features.
Usually tied to [🧑‍🚀 Actions beekeepers make](../products/🧑‍🚀%20Actions%20beekeepers%20make.md)

## Features and Ideas
These are unique abilities a product offers as a solution to [🌨️ Problems](../🌨️%20Problems/🌨️%20Problems.md)

### Adding new idea
You can add new idea by creating [a new file via github](https://github.com/Gratheon/website/tree/main/about/products/%F0%9F%93%B1Web-app/pro%20tier/ideas%20%F0%9F%92%A1) and describing it in markdown format

### Feature lifecycle
We separate ideas and features by product and by tier to have better separation of which repository and device it its tied to the most. Separation by tier is tied to the complexity of the task and how much does it cost to maintain infrastructure.

See for example - [community tier features](../products/📱Web-app/community%20tier/features%20✅/), [essential tier features](../products/📱Web-app/essential%20tier/features%20✅/).

Feature has multiple tasks associated with it.

## Tasks
Tasks are steps a feature is implemented.
Tasks are taken by individual contributors and [Volunteers ❤️‍🔥](Volunteers%20❤️‍🔥/Volunteers%20❤️‍🔥.md)
We don't use explicit tools like JIRA, Trello, Notion or ClickUp for managing tasks because they separate us from the documentation. Instead tasks are also managed as plain markdown files.
To take on a task, just make a markdown file and add yourself as the assignee to let everyone know that you are dealing with the task.
