**Role Description**

This is a volunteer role for a Full Stack Engineer at Gratheon. As a Full Stack Engineer, you will be responsible for developing and maintaining both the front-end and back-end components of our web applications. You will work closely with our team to design and implement new features, optimize application performance, and ensure a smooth user experience. This is a hybrid role, with the primary location in Tallinn but with the flexibility to work remotely.

**Qualifications**

- Proficiency in software development and microservice architecture
- Main tech stack - typescript / react, nodejs, go, python, graphql, mysql, docker
- Testing automation experience (jest/mocha, go test, pytest, different test types)

Optional, yet highly valued beneficial skills:

- beekeeping experience as domain knowledge
- video streaming/processing experience
- embedded software development for IoT devices and robotics
- machine learning
- ecosystem sustainability and environmental restoration

As a volunteer, you will not receive any monetary compensation (until we get pre-seed round investments). This is an opportunity to join a company at very early phase, learn things, have fun in the process and be part of the open-source community.
