ðŸ’¡ This is a placeholder page for how the company should like. 

A matrix-structure organization organizes its work into verticals and horizontal layers. A vertical is a business and product-oriented full stack view on the system that owns specific set of features (ex. hive management team). This approach is encouraged to form teams.

A horizontal layer is an implementation focused, specialized, technological mean to solve part of the problem that is complex enough that it requires a dedicated [Roles](Team/Roles/Roles.md) and a dedicated person or a team (ex. infrastructure team). This approach is encouraged only for communication on same topics.
