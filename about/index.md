Gratheon develops open, modular robotic beehive as a data service for [👨🏻‍🚀 Semi-professional beekeepers](products/clients/👨🏻‍🚀%20Semi-professional%20beekeepers.md) to save bees 🐝, improve efficiency and scale beekeeping. Globally we increase food security through precise pollination.


## 1 min pitch
### Problem
On average 20% to 40 % of colonies die every year. They die from hunger, [🦀 Varroa Mite Infestations](./🌨️%20Problems/🦀%20Infestations.md), late  [🧶 Swarming](./🌨️%20Problems/🧶%20Swarming.md) or because beekeeper was too lazy to lift heavy beehives to inspect them every 2 weeks.

## Solution
My name is Artjom we at Gratheon develop a new type of beehive that inspects the bees automatically. It consists of 3 devices that send data about beehive and an app that analyzes weight, images and video with AI and alerts the user to improve awareness and prevent collapse.

We are targeting [👨🏻‍🚀 semi-professional beekeepers](./products/clients/👨🏻‍🚀%20Semi-professional%20beekeepers.md) in Europe.  
We have around 200 registered users.

We are a [small team](company/Team/index.md) are engineers and researchers from companies like Pipedrive, Clarifai, Fits.me, Taltech.  We are open source and had [lots of volunteers](volunteer.md).

## Ask
We are raising 40 thousands euros in pre-seed angel investments to bootstrap our product.  Join us to help 2 million beekeepers and their cute & fuzzy bees.
