Gratheon develops open, modular robotic beehive as a data service for [👨🏻‍🚀 Semi-professional beekeepers](products/clients/👨🏻‍🚀%20Semi-professional%20beekeepers.md) to save bees 🐝, improve efficiency and scale beekeeping. Globally we increase food security through precise pollination.


## Pitch
📢 We are building a robotic beehive! 5 years ago I became a beekeeper to improve pollination of my garden and to take care of the super organisms of bees.

Soon I understood that bees can [🧶 Swarm](./🌨️%20Problems/🧶%20Swarming.md) and get [🦀 Varroa Mite Infestations](./🌨️%20Problems/🦀%20Infestations.md). 
I had to regularly lift heavy beehives sections to inspect and treat bees.
Some colonies got weak and died over the winter. 
Losing a colony is not just 300 euros of monetary loss, its also a personal failure. 
On average 20% to 40 % of colonies die every year.

Imagine a new type of beehive that inspects the bees automatically.
This would save time, reduce loss of bees, require less inspections.
[👨🏻‍🚀 semi-professional beekeepers](./products/clients/👨🏻‍🚀%20Semi-professional%20beekeepers.md) could have more beehives and could see colony development over time automatically. 
[🧑🏻‍🌾 Farmers](products/clients/🧑🏻‍🌾%20Farmers.md) would get more pollination services and have 40% more crop yields.

[Our team](company/Team/index.md) are experienced engineers and researchers from companies like Pipedrive, Clarifai, Fits.me, Taltech and we are raising 1M pre-seed investments for 2 years of runway. Angels and [volunteers](❤️‍🔥%20Volunteers.md) are also welcome.

Join us to help 2 million beekeepers and their cute & fuzzy bees.
