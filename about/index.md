Gratheon develops open, modular robotic beehive as a data service for [👨🏻‍🚀 Semi-professional beekeepers](products/clients/👨🏻‍🚀%20Semi-professional%20beekeepers.md) to save bees 🐝, improve efficiency and scale beekeeping. Globally we increase food security through precise pollination.


## Pitch
📢 Hi everyone, my name is Artjom and we at Gratheon are building a robotic beehive! 
## Problem
On average 20% to 40 % of colonies die every year. They die from hunger, [🦀 Varroa Mite Infestations](./🌨️%20Problems/🦀%20Infestations.md), late  [🧶 Swarming](./🌨️%20Problems/🧶%20Swarming.md) or because beekeeper is not experienced.

I had to regularly lift heavy beehives sections to inspect and treat bees. Almost every year some of the colonies got weak and died over the winter.  Losing a colony is not just 300 euros of monetary loss, its also a personal failure. 


Imagine a new type of beehive that inspects the bees automatically. It consists of several devices. All of the data gets into an app which helps reduces loss of bees, and requires less inspections.

[👨🏻‍🚀 semi-professional beekeepers](./products/clients/👨🏻‍🚀%20Semi-professional%20beekeepers.md) could have more beehives and could see colony development over time automatically. 
[🧑🏻‍🌾 Farmers](products/clients/🧑🏻‍🌾%20Farmers.md) would get more pollination services and have 40% more crop yields.

[Our team](company/Team/index.md) are engineers and researchers from companies like Pipedrive, Clarifai, Fits.me, Taltech and we are raising 1M pre-seed investments for 2 years of runway. Angels and [volunteers](volunteer.md) are also welcome.

We are raising 40 thousands euros in pre-seed angel investments to bootstrap our product. Join us to help 2 million beekeepers and their cute & fuzzy bees.
