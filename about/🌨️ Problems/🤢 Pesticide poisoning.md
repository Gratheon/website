## Problem

Farmers use pesticide on fields to treat against insects. When done in blooming time, this also affects the bees, which may still come back to the hive and die

Pesticide chemicals gets passed though stored in pollen and affects brood development. Hives become defensiveness, lack of foragers and die of starvation
