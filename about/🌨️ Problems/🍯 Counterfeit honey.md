Counterfeit honey has become a growing challenge for beekeepers, consumers, and the entire apiculture industry. This problem arises when honey products are adulterated with cheaper sweeteners like corn syrup, rice syrup, or other non-natural additives. Some counterfeit honey is even produced entirely synthetically, bypassing bees altogether. This fraudulent practice not only undermines the hard work of ethical beekeepers but also devalues the purity and quality of real honey.
