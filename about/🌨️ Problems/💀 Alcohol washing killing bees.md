Beekeepers worldwide face a persistent challenge in maintaining the health of their colonies: accurately monitoring Varroa mite infestations. These parasitic mites are a major threat to honeybee populations, weakening colonies by feeding on developing bees and spreading viruses. To assess the level of infestation, many beekeepers rely on alcohol wash tests, a method that involves shaking a sample of bees in alcohol to separate and count the mites. While this method is highly effective in determining mite loads, it comes at the cost of sacrificing hundreds of bees from the hiveâ€”a practice that many beekeepers find distressing and counterproductive to their conservation efforts.

At Gratheon, we believe that beekeeping shouldn't have to pit colony health against individual bee survival. This is why we are developing advanced solutions like AI-powered vision devices and robotic beehives. Our hive entrance monitors use image recognition and machine learning to count and detect mites on bees in real-time without harming them. Combined with IoT sensors that track environmental conditions and hive health, our technologies provide non-invasive, data-driven insights into Varroa populations. By eliminating the need for alcohol washing, we aim to empower beekeepers with sustainable tools that prioritize the well-being of every bee, strengthening colonies against threats while preserving their vital role in our ecosystems.
