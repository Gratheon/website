# 🐝 Detect swarming

**Status**: `idea` | **Development Stage**: `concept` | **Priority**: `high`

### 🎯 Purpose
Automatically detect swarm preparation and swarming events at the hive entrance to provide early warning for beekeepers to take preventive action.

### 🎭 User Story
- As a beekeeper concerned about losing valuable bee colonies
- I want to receive early alerts when my hives show signs of swarming preparation
- So that I can intervene with management techniques to prevent swarm departure and colony loss

### 🚀 Key Benefits
- **Colony preservation**: Prevent valuable bee colony losses through early detection
- **Proactive management**: Enable timely intervention with swarm prevention techniques
- **Seasonal insights**: Track swarming patterns and seasonal triggers
- **Economic protection**: Avoid production losses from reduced colony strength

### 🔧 Technical Overview
Analyzes unusual activity patterns, increased traffic volumes, and behavioral changes at the entrance that precede swarming events. Combines bee counting data with movement pattern analysis to detect characteristic pre-swarm and swarm behaviors including scout bee activity and mass exodus patterns.

### 📋 Acceptance Criteria
- Detects pre-swarm behavior indicators 24-48 hours before swarm departure
- Identifies actual swarming events with >85% accuracy
- Distinguishes between swarming and other high-activity events (robbing, orientation flights)
- Provides real-time alerts through notification system
- Tracks swarm probability scoring over time
- Functions across different bee subspecies and seasonal conditions

### 🚫 Out of Scope
- Inside-hive queen cell detection (requires robotic beehive integration)
- Weather correlation analysis (basic environmental data only)
- Automatic swarm prevention actions (alert system only)
- Post-swarm colony assessment and recovery recommendations

### 🏗️ Implementation Approach
- **Pattern analysis**: Statistical analysis of traffic volume anomalies and timing patterns
- **Behavior detection**: Machine learning model trained on known swarm events
- **Alert system**: Integration with existing notification infrastructure
- **Data sources**: Bee counting, movement patterns, interaction frequencies
- **Validation**: Historical data analysis and field testing during swarm season

### 📊 Success Metrics
- Early warning accuracy >80% for pre-swarm detection
- Swarm event detection accuracy >85%
- False positive rate <20% to maintain user trust
- Alert delivery time <5 minutes from detection
- Seasonal pattern recognition across multiple apiaries
