# 🎮 Device management - Remote desktop

**Status**: `idea` | **Development Stage**: `concept` | **Priority**: `medium`

### 🎯 Purpose
Enables remote desktop access to entrance observer devices for troubleshooting, configuration, and maintenance without physical access.

### 🎭 User Story
- As a beekeeper with deployed entrance observer devices
- I want to remotely access and manage my device's operating system
- So that I can troubleshoot issues, update configurations, and maintain devices without visiting the apiary

### 🚀 Key Benefits
- **Remote troubleshooting**: Diagnose and fix issues without field visits
- **Easy maintenance**: Update software, adjust settings, and monitor device health
- **Cost efficiency**: Reduce travel time and maintenance costs for remote apiaries
- **Professional support**: Enable technical support team to assist users directly

### 🔧 Technical Overview
Establishes secure VPN connections between devices and cloud infrastructure using reverse SSH tunnels or VPN solutions. Provides web-based remote desktop access through noVNC client, allowing full operating system control through web browsers.

### 📋 Acceptance Criteria
- Establishes secure connection through NAT/firewall without port forwarding
- Provides full Ubuntu desktop access through web browser
- Maintains connection stability for 30+ minute sessions
- Supports concurrent access for user and support team
- Integrates with existing device authentication system
- Shows device online/offline status in web application

### 🚫 Out of Scope
- File transfer capabilities (basic remote access only)
- Multi-user simultaneous desktop sessions
- Mobile app native remote access
- Permanent VPN client installation requirements

### 🏗️ Implementation Approach
- **VPN Solution**: Headscale (open-source Tailscale alternative) or ZeroTier
- **Remote Access**: noVNC web client for browser-based desktop access
- **Security**: API token authentication and encrypted tunnel connections
- **Connection**: Reverse SSH tunnel from device to cloud infrastructure
- **Interface**: Iframe integration in main web application

### 📊 Success Metrics
- Connection success rate >90% for devices with internet connectivity
- Session startup time <60 seconds from click to desktop
- Connection stability >95% for standard troubleshooting sessions
- User satisfaction with remote support experience >4/5
- Reduction in field service calls by >50%
