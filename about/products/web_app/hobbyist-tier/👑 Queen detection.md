title: 👑 Queen Detection
---

### 🎯 Purpose
Automatically detect your queen bee in uploaded frame photos to quickly confirm queen presence and avoid the stress of searching through thousands of bees during inspections.

### 🎭 User Story
- As a beekeeper concerned about colony health
- I want AI to help me spot my queen in frame photos
- So that I can quickly verify queen presence without prolonged inspections that stress the colony

### 🚀 Key Benefits
- **Fast Queen Verification**: Upload a photo and let AI scan for your queen in seconds
- **Reduce Inspection Time**: No need to meticulously search every frame during each inspection
- **Visual Confirmation**: See detected queens highlighted with bounding boxes on your photos
- **Track Queen Location**: Build a history of which frames your queen prefers over time
- **Early Warning**: Get alerts if no queen is detected over multiple inspections

### 💡 Use Cases

**Quick Queen Check**
After requeening or during weekly inspections, quickly verify your queen is present without extensive frame-by-frame search.

**New Beekeeper Confidence**
If you're still learning to spot queens, use AI detection as training wheels to confirm you're looking at the right bee.

**Post-Split Verification**
After splitting a hive, confirm which colony has the queen by uploading photos from both new colonies.

**Queen Loss Alert**
If AI doesn't detect a queen over 2-3 consecutive inspections, you'll get an early warning to check for queen cups or consider requeening.

### 🎓 How to Use

1. **Upload frame photo** - Take photos of frames where you suspect the queen might be
2. **Wait for AI analysis** - Detection runs automatically (10-30 seconds)
3. **Review results** - Queen detections appear as highlighted boxes on your photo
4. **Verify accuracy** - Click detected queens to mark them as correct or false positives
5. **Track over time** - View queen detection history across inspections

#### 📸 Photo Tips for Best Detection
- **Lighting**: Bright, even lighting helps AI distinguish queen from workers
- **Focus**: Keep camera steady for sharp, in-focus images
- **Coverage**: Capture full frame to avoid missing queen at edges
- **Angle**: Shoot perpendicular to frame surface

### ⚠️ Current Limitations
- **Accuracy**: Detection is currently in beta with moderate accuracy (~60-70%)
- **False Positives**: May occasionally mark large worker bees or drones as queens
- **Model Improvement**: We're actively training better models with more data
