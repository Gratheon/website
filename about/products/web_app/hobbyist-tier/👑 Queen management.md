title: 👑 Queen Management
---

### 🎯 Purpose
Track your queen's lifecycle, breeding information, and location history to monitor colony reproductive health and make informed decisions about requeening or breeding programs.

### 🎭 User Story
- As a beekeeper managing multiple colonies
- I want to track which frames have queens and monitor their lifecycle status
- So that I can quickly diagnose reproductive issues and maintain healthy colonies

### 🚀 Key Benefits
- **Lifecycle Tracking**: Monitor your queen's stage from virgin to laying to old & infertile
- **Breeding Records**: Document queen race, year, and genetics for lineage tracking
- **Location History**: Remember which frames your queen prefers over time
- **Health Diagnosis**: Understand if missing brood is due to queenless colony or unmated queen
- **Timeline View**: See when your queen was last spotted and track status changes
- **Breeding Planning**: Track queen ages across your apiary to plan replacements

### 💡 Use Cases

**Track Queen Age**
Mark your queen with year color and record it in the app. Get reminders when queens reach 2-3 years old and may need replacement.

**Diagnose Reproductive Issues**
No brood in your hive? Check queen status: if marked as "virgin" or "mating", she may not be laying yet. If status is "old & infertile", time to requeen.

**Breeding Program Management**
Track which hives have queens from your best colonies. Record queen genetics and race to maintain desirable traits across your operation.

**Post-Split Queen Tracking**
After splitting a hive, track which colony got the original queen and monitor the other for new queen emergence and mating flights.

### 🎓 How to Use

1. **Mark queen location** - When you spot your queen on a frame, mark that frame in the app
2. **Set lifecycle stage** - Update status: queen cup → virgin → mating → laying → old & infertile
3. **Record breeding info** - Add queen race, year marked, and genetics if known
4. **Track over time** - Timeline shows queen sightings and status changes
5. **Plan replacements** - View all queens in your apiary sorted by age

#### 👑 Queen Lifecycle Stages

- **Queen Cup** - Colony is raising a new queen
- **Virgin** - New queen emerged but not yet mated (7-14 days)
- **Mating** - Queen is on mating flights (1-2 weeks)
- **Laying** - Actively laying eggs (1-3 years typical lifespan)
- **Old & Infertile** - Reduced laying or drone-laying queen (time to replace)

#### 🎨 Queen Marking by Year
- White - 2021, 2026
- Yellow - 2022, 2027
- Red - 2023, 2028
- Green - 2024, 2029
- Blue - 2025, 2030

### 🔍 Integration with Detection
Works with automated queen detection - when AI finds a queen in your photo, you'll see a suggestion to mark that frame. You can confirm or override AI detections.
