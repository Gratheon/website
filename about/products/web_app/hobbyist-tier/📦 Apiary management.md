### 🎯 Purpose
Organize your beehives into apiaries based on location, making it easy to manage multiple sites and plan efficient inspection routes across all your bee yards.

### 💡 Use Cases

**Hobby Beekeeper with Multiple Locations**
Keep 3 hives in your backyard and 2 at a friend's farm. Create "Home Apiary" and "Farm Apiary" to organize them separately for easier management.

**Urban Beekeeper**
Manage hives across community gardens, rooftops, and parks. Create apiaries for each location to track which sites need attention.

**Sideline Beekeeper**
Run 20-50 hives across 3-5 locations. Organize apiaries by site to plan efficient inspection routes and track performance by location.

**Commercial Pollination**
Move hives between orchards and fields. Create temporary apiaries for each pollination contract location.
