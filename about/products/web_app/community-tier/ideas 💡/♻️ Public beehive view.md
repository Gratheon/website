For [Growth loops](https://www.notion.so/Growth-loops-ee0adfb601b5474393fc412a7cc5837d?pvs=21) and marketing, we need users to be able to share their beehive view with others

This task is about SHOWING the beehive state to others, whereas [Share of beehive inspection public URL](https://www.notion.so/Share-of-beehive-inspection-public-URL-477d096f683542f4a182e53ff5f23780?pvs=21) is about creating a link

### Suggested solution

- If user is logged in and it is userâ€™s beehive, then redirect user to hive edit view
    - This is needed for a case when user is out in the field and uses [QR-code printing & scanning](https://www.notion.so/QR-code-printing-scanning-8a3c2b281f4e4d4c907e01f7ecc1f3fa?pvs=21) feature to access beehive from a sticker
- Create new view that does not need user to be logged in, similar to Login view
- Include info in there:
    - frames photos
    - location if allowed by [Apiary position sharing](https://www.notion.so/Apiary-position-sharing-d78e6d14915b49efbb8d8cba331d3542?pvs=21)
    - video stream if its available
