In case internet is not available, we should still be able to display some statistics on the display (if its available) to the beekeeper. So we need some hive-app interface for this.

- If we use nvidia-jetson like device and a display, then we can show this UI to the end user
- If not, we can serve a web-server like access over the network, like routers do
- Show entrance-observer metrics in this app, maybe stream a video on it too
