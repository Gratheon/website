## Why

The idea is that we can stream video from phone. If beekeepers have old phones, they can use them instead of buying dedicated devices.

This approach is alternative to programmatic Video streaming API which requires custom device, scripts and API tokens.

This assumes lots of things

- user has good internet (wifi or cellular)
- they can protect phone from the weather
- they setup power usage (cord, battery or solar)+
- phone doesnâ€™t die/heat from so much video recording

## User story

- Beekeeper opens his [Mobile app / google play app](https://www.notion.so/Mobile-app-google-play-app-1baf0593535c4076a8aa619a2a665925?pvs=21)
    
- Creates or opens a hive of his choice
