The problem here is that say you have 3 fields with a monocultural crop. If you place hives near it, the crops bloom ends and now your bees can’t gather anything. So you want to solve monocultural crop problems with mobile apiaries. But we don’t want to use human labour of loading and unloading hives.

Instead, we want hives to get moved automatically to the right location

We also want right location to be calculated and suggested by another feature [Pollination optimization with hive placement recommendation](https://www.notion.so/Pollination-optimization-with-hive-placement-recommendation-c824e0e6b0c441c2a7815057ef0958d5?pvs=21)

Suggested distance that robot could travel - 20km

## Solution

- either move entire [Robotic Apiary](https://www.notion.so/Robotic-Apiary-c14f4ea70f3146b5868a2d7874b8a958?pvs=21) on wheels to new location
- or have [Robotic Apiary](https://www.notion.so/Robotic-Apiary-c14f4ea70f3146b5868a2d7874b8a958?pvs=21) as a bot that can move individual hives
- this likely needs to be moved at night time
- and this likely will fall under remotely controlled cars, so it may have legislation problems if movement is done on public roads
