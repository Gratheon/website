We want beekeepers to be aware of their apiary state

Specifically:

- hive sections (number)
    - which need cleaning
    - which need repainting
- frames (number)
    - frames
        - without foundation
        - with foundation

Group by resources:

- honey estimate
    - how many frames with honey got extracted for harvest
- wax estimate
    - how many frames got extracted with honey → cap removal = wax
    - how many frames have brown foundation and need melting

Group by actions

- honey extraction → wax melting → frame foundation rewiring
- clean → repair
- burn / compost
- buy new
