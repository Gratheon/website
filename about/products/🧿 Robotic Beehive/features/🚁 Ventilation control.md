## Problem

Hives without good ventilation tend to get high humidity, mold and colony collapse

At hot ðŸ”…weather, bees tend to do ventilating themselves and waste some bee worker resources

## Suggested solution

- Related to [Hive heating](https://www.notion.so/Hive-heating-dd3ff3f6c23a4793bdc04928a2cabdd4?pvs=21) feature, we could keep hive internals at constant 32-35.5 C
- Add a fan on the bottom of the hive that would increase air flow when its too hot ðŸ”…
- We probably should NOT run a fan if its too cold, otherwise bees can get chilled brood
- Get data from [Humidity monitoring](https://www.notion.so/Humidity-monitoring-1daa7dc3356048b8a807e7b099bc70f4?pvs=21)
    - Basically if relative humidity is > 90%, turn on the fan
    - Allow user to set min humidity level at which point fan should turn on
    - Allow user to set fan speed
