## Goal

For managing beehive monitoring in remote areas, beekeepers need electrical autonomy

We should be able to provide some solution to help beekeepers, as we know the max consumption and can estimate needed energy

- [Jetson Orin Nano](https://www.notion.so/Jetson-Orin-Nano-0432edfb44f748a6874c41ddefa7f69c?pvs=21) needs min 20w of power

## Suggested solution
- A good accumulator
    - Likely placed under the hive for best weight distribution
- A solar panel to power accumulator

## Alternatively
- [Wind speed measurement (Anemometer)](https://www.notion.so/Wind-speed-measurement-Anemometer-519c03daeec041cfabcbe74087e46e7e?pvs=21) to power accumulator
- Fuel cell
