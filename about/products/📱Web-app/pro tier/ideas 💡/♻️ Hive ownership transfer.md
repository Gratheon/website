The idea behind this feature is that beekeepers tend to buy NUCs (bee packages) from other beekeepers. It would be good if history of past bees was passed down between people.

So if [↔️ Create colony split](↔️%20Create%20colony%20split.md) is made and sold to another beekeeper, then old beekeeper could mark colony as sold to (enter email of new user), then new user would automatically get a copy of the past data into his account.
