- Find specific crop fields for specialized (buckweed) pollination and honey harvesting
- Optimize for pollen diversity (bee health)
- Optimize for max nectar flow
- Minimize pollution sources
- Minimize for non-pollinateable
- Optimize for road access

💡 Given a data on fieds and nearby plants, we could suggest to beekeeper how to optimize hive placement for more efficient coverage area or pollen diversity

💡 Given a birds-eye view, show how ☀️ sun moves relative to the hive entrance. Place objects (house, tree) relative to the hive that can shade the hive. Hypothesis is that shade affects hive temperature and thus, efficiency
