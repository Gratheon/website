    - if user selected more files than frame sides - ignore them, but do add a warning message on top with a list of filenames that were ignored.
        - If ignored list is > 3, add `...` at the end and ignore the rest.

    - show the progress if possible at least in amount of files, ex. `Uploaded 3 of 12 files`
- Files are assigned to frame sides, starting **from the left to the right â†’**
