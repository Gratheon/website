An idea coming from this research paper:

[Varroa destructor detection on honey bees using hyperspectral imagery](https://www.notion.so/Varroa-destructor-detection-on-honey-bees-using-hyperspectral-imagery-d182dc94968245df84219a4a91ecab4b?pvs=21)

Its still questionable wether we can have a relatively cheap IR camera and if the method would work on frames or on entrance video stream
