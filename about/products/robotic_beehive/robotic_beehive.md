We are developing a robotic vertical beehive inspection platform, capable of lifting hive sections and helping beekeeper to inspect the hive.

This device allows beekeepers to reduce physical effort needed in inspections, while adding easy ability to capture frame photos with built-in cameras automatically uploading them to the [web app](../web_app/web_app.md). 

`status`: [TRL 2](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/somd/space-communications-navigation-program/technology-readiness-levels/)

### Target clients

Single-colony robot will cost a lot (>2000 EUR) and. Because of this, it is unlikely that [👨🏻‍🚒 Industrial beekeepers](../clients/👨🏻‍🚒%20Industrial%20beekeepers.md) or [🧑🏻‍🌾 Farmers](../clients/🧑🏻‍🌾%20Farmers.md) (that have >20 beehives) will buy it. Instead, we position it as a luxury item that compliments customer brand.

- [👨🏻 Potential new beekeepers](../clients/👨🏻%20Potential%20new%20beekeepers.md) ← as a shiny and safe beehive that can also teach them beekeeping
- [👩🏼‍🏫 Urban beekeepers](../clients/👩🏼‍🏫%20Urban%20beekeepers.md) ← as a way to research how bees are behaving and avoid disturbing neighbours
- [👩🏻 Tech scale-up companies](../clients/👩🏻%20Tech%20scale-up%20companies.md) ← for office roof as a brand building hardware and a in-house honey perk

## Non-functional requirements

Extraction should happen without disturbing the bees, exposing them to elements or risking people around.

- able to adjust to frame size and hive section size of customer’s choice (Langstroth, Farrar, National etc)
- should not harm human operator - @Regulations and Compliance (ex. breaking hands)
- not kill 🐝 bees [squashing with moving mechanisms, cause hypothermia, open to stealing or attacks via cracks]
- be able to extract frame if bees glued it with wax
- not 🔥 ignite from overheating, sun, electrical wiring etc. Beewax is highly flammable
- move frame that is full of honey (4kg)
- be repairable (modular, hot-swappable)
- be offline-first. Provide data to beekeeper without internet or cloud account
- provide manual on-site control over frame movement
- fallback to safe mode on power loss

## Prototype

Consists of actuators that can move the frame in/out, GPU, cameras. Very early stage as we’re focusing on [Web-app](https://www.notion.so/Web-app-2937ed264e1d434a8664caa4bc40978e?pvs=21) and [Entrance Observer](https://www.notion.so/Entrance-Observer-b0319799ab7744dc928c08119de4fc43?pvs=21) first.
