- Squashing of bees when hive sections and frames are moved and placed on top of each other
- Death of warrior-bees due to stings of beekeeper
- Using a smoker leads to hightened stress due to fear of forest fire
- Over the time of the inspection (10 min), bees raise their alert level (hightening the buzzing volume) in fear of their brood getting chilled. Sudden movements increas risk of sudden attack
