# What we do

Gratheon develops an open source, modular, [🧿 Robotic Beehive](products/🧿%20Robotic%20Beehive/🧿%20Robotic%20Beehive.md) as a data service for [👨🏻‍🚀 Semi-professional beekeepers](products/clients/👨🏻‍🚀%20Semi-professional%20beekeepers.md) to save bees 🐝, improve efficiency and increase food security through scalable precise pollination.

- **modular** means that we have multiple devices at different price points that construct different information about bee colony
- **data service** means that we earn money from subscription service for managing hive data such as timeseries telemetry, image and video footage that is processed using AI models
- **scalable precise pollination** means that using our service, beekeepers can manage more bee colonies and they can be placed at the right location farmers and bees would benefit the most to cover crop field most efficiently

### Elevator pitch for the investors 💶
📢 Do you like honey, how about apples? 5 years ago I became a beekeeper to get both by improving pollination of my garden and taking care of the cutest bees.

Soon enough I understood that bees can [🧶 Swarm](../🌨️%20Problems/🧶%20Swarming.md) and get [🦀 Varroa Mite Infestations](../🌨️%20Problems/🦀%20Infestations.md). To manage that, I had to lift heavy beehives every week to inspect and treat bees, otherwise they would get weak and die over the winter. And I did lose lots of fami

Imagine a new type of modular robotic beehive that inspects the bees and [👨🏻‍🚀 semi-professional beekeepers](../products/clients/👨🏻‍🚀%20Semi-professional%20beekeepers.md) see colony development over time automatically. This allows to save time, travel to the field and scale precise pollination, giving 40% more crop yields to farmers.

We are engineers from companies like Pipedrive, Clarifai, Fits.me and we are raising either 30k angel to keep bootstrapping or 1M pre-seed investments for 2 years of runway. 
Join us to help 2 million beekeepers.
