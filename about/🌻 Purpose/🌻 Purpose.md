# What we do

We help 🧑🏻‍🚀 beekeepers with 🐝 AI observability and 🤖 robotic automation. 
We provide [products](../products/index.md) so that beekeepers become more **efficient** and their colonies stay **healthy**.

We help 🧑🏻‍🚀 beekeepers to model and organize their apiary 🐝 using our web-app. We develop and integrate IoT devices with camera and AI vision to report vital colony metrics and alert beekeepers in case of danger. Our long-term vision is a [**Robotic Beehive**](https://www.notion.so/Robotic-Beehive-fd9559a2950b44bc8291972299ced18e?pvs=21)

### Elevator pitch

📢 I’m a software engineer and 5 years ago I became a beekeeper to improve pollination of my garden and get higher yields. To me, bees are also a cute pet


> Bees are key species for our food security. Farmers are cooperating with beekeepers to combat [Insufficient pollination](https://www.notion.so/Insufficient-pollination-93d31ab6309443f9bbe0a50f4b560188?pvs=21) and increase yields

But traditional beekeeping requires [👁️ Observability of bee colony](../🌨️%20Problems/👁️%20Observability%20of%20bee%20colony.md), because bees can experience  [🍽️ Bee colony starvation](../🌨️%20Problems/🍽️%20Bee%20colony%20starvation.md), [💀 Colony without a queen](../🌨️%20Problems/💀%20Colony%20without%20a%20queen.md), [🧶 Swarming](../🌨️%20Problems/🧶%20Swarming.md), [🦀 Infestations](../🌨️%20Problems/🦀%20Infestations.md)   and [🦀 Diseases](../🌨️%20Problems/🦀%20Diseases.md) which weaken the colony and cause [❄️ Overwintering collapse](../🌨️%20Problems/❄️%20Overwintering%20collapse.md) .

Observability is typically solved with a [💪🏻 Physical labor](../🌨️%20Problems/💪🏻%20Physical%20labor.md)  and [👁️ Time-consuming inspections](../🌨️%20Problems/👁️%20Time-consuming%20inspections.md). Dressed in a protective suit, in the summer heat, every week, you need to lift 20 kg beehive sections designed 150 years ago and notice small details while you are getting stung by defending bees, [💀 Intrusive inspections](../🌨️%20Problems/💀%20Intrusive%20inspections.md)

As your apiary grows, this becomes [💪🏻 Unscalable work](../🌨️%20Problems/💪🏻%20Unscalable%20work.md). [👨🏻‍🚒 Industrial beekeepers](../products/clients/👨🏻‍🚒%20Industrial%20beekeepers.md) have [🏘️ Multiple apiaries](../🌨️%20Problems/🏘️%20Multiple%20apiaries.md)  at [🌲 Distant locations](../🌨️%20Problems/🌲%20Distant%20locations.md) that are hard to reach. Existing solutions do not adequately solve these issues
  
## Solution

💡 Our solution is a beekeeping [📱Web-app](../products/📱Web-app/📱Web-app.md) software as a service working in conjunction with fully autonomous multi-hive [🧿 Robotic Beehive](../products/🧿%20Robotic%20Beehive/🧿%20Robotic%20Beehive.md)  that can remotely inspect and manipulate beehives.

Our primary customers at first phases of platform development are [👨🏻‍🚀 Backyard beekeepers](../products/clients/👨🏻‍🚀%20Backyard%20beekeepers.md) that need data analytics with [🌡️ Beehive IoT sensors](../products/🌡️%20Beehive%20IoT%20sensors/🌡️%20Beehive%20IoT%20sensors.md) and [👁️‍🗨️ Entrance Observer](../products/👁️‍🗨️%20Entrance%20Observer/👁️‍🗨️%20Entrance%20Observer.md) to partially solve  observability of beehives and have decide on [🧑‍🚀 actions beekeepers need to make](../products/🧑‍🚀%20Actions%20beekeepers%20make.md) further

Our secondary customers once we have [🧿 Robotic Beehive](../products/🧿%20Robotic%20Beehive/🧿%20Robotic%20Beehive.md) prototype would be [👨🏻‍🚒 Industrial beekeepers](../products/clients/👨🏻‍🚒%20Industrial%20beekeepers.md) and [🧑🏻‍🌾 Farmers](../products/clients/🧑🏻‍🌾%20Farmers.md), they have pain to automate their work with robot. They need large data analysis and automation to reduce manual labour. 

Saving bees improves pollination efficiency, farmers get more crops, beekeepers get more money, which funds us.

Join us to improve life of 100 million bee colonies worldwide.

## For Hiring new engineers

Gratheon is a technology company based in Tallinn, Estonia that focuses on helping beekeepers organise and automate their apiaries. We develop web application that integrates with IoT devices to provide real-time metrics for beekeeping operations. Our use of machine learning allows us to identify and alert beekeepers of potential dangers. As part of our long-term vision, we aim to automate this process with robots. Our code is open source and processes are transparent.
