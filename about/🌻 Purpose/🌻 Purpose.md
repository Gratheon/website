# What we do

We help 🧑🏻‍🚀 beekeepers with 🐝 AI observability and 🤖 robotic automation. 
We provide [products](../products/index.md) so that beekeepers become more **efficient** and their colonies stay **healthy**.

We help 🧑🏻‍🚀 beekeepers to model and organize their apiary 🐝 using our web-app. We develop and integrate IoT devices with camera and AI vision to report vital colony metrics and alert beekeepers in case of danger. Our long-term vision is a [**Robotic Beehive**](https://www.notion.so/Robotic-Beehive-fd9559a2950b44bc8291972299ced18e?pvs=21)
## For investors 💶
Gratheon is a data analytics app and hardware devices that help beekeepers do less manual labour and keeps bees healthy

### Elevator pitch
📢 Do you love honey? 5 years ago I became a beekeeper to improve pollination of my garden and get more apples.

Soon enough I understood that bees can [🧶 Swarm](../🌨️%20Problems/🧶%20Swarming.md) and get [🦀 Varroa Mite Infestations](../🌨️%20Problems/🦀%20Infestations.md). 
Beekeeper needs to lift heavy beehives every week to inspect and treat bees, otherwise bees get weak and die over the winter. 

Imagine a new type of modular robotic beehive that inspects the bees and [👨🏻‍🚀 semi-professional beekeepers](../products/clients/👨🏻‍🚀%20Semi-professional%20beekeepers.md) see colony development over time automatically. This allows to save time, travel to the field and scale precise pollination, giving 40% more crop yields to farmers.

We are engineers from companies like Pipedrive, Clarifai, Fits.me and we are raising either 30k angel to keep bootstrapping or 1M pre-seed investments for 2 years of runway. 
Join us to help 2 million beekeepers.
