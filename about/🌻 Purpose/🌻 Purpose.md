We help 🧑🏻‍🚀 beekeepers to model and organize their apiary 🐝 using our web-app. We develop and integrate IoT devices with camera and AI vision to report vital colony metrics and alert beekeepers in case of danger. Our long-term vision is a [**Robotic Beehive**](https://www.notion.so/Robotic-Beehive-fd9559a2950b44bc8291972299ced18e?pvs=21)

### Elevator pitch

📢 5 years ago I worked at Pipedrive as a software engineer, I became a beekeeper to improve pollination of my garden and get more apples. To me, bees are also a cute pet like a cat

Soon enough I understood that bees can experience [🧶 Swarming](../🌨️%20Problems/🧶%20Swarming.md), [🦀 Infestations](../🌨️%20Problems/🦀%20Infestations.md)  or [🍽️ Bee colony starvation](../🌨️%20Problems/🍽️%20Bee%20colony%20starvation.md) and I need to inspect bees on a weekly basis, otherwise I would lose 300 euros for a single colony. I had to lift 20 kg beehive sections and notice small details while you are getting stung by defending bees and accidentally squishing bees. This is not scalable if I would have tens or hundreds of beehives.

💡 Our solution is a SaaS [📱Web-app](../products/📱Web-app/📱Web-app.md), IoT devices, AI vision and a robots that should help [👨🏻‍🚀 Semi-professional beekeepers](../products/clients/👨🏻‍🚀%20Semi-professional%20beekeepers.md) and empower them selling their services to farmers. Saving bees improves pollination efficiency, farmers get more crops, beekeepers get more money, which funds us.

We are engineers from companies like Pipedrive, Clarifai, Fits.me and we are raising angel or pre-seed investments.
