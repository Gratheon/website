As drones consume the hive\u2019s resources without contributing, the colony can suffer from a lack of workers to forage, maintain hive structure, and care for the brood. Without intervention, the colony may eventually collapse. Identifying and replacing a drone-laying queen is a common remedy, but it requires keen observation and sometimes the use of specialized technology to monitor the health and dynamics of the hive. Advanced solutions, such as AI-powered hive monitoring tools and IoT sensors, can provide beekeepers with real-time data to identify such issues early, ensuring the timely management of the colony and preventing hive loss."})]})}function h(e={}){const{wrapper:n}={...(0,i.R)(),...e.components};return n?(0,t.jsx)(n,{...e,children:(0,t.jsx)(u,{...e})}):u(e)}},28453:(e,n,o)=>{o.d(n,{R:()=>a,x:()=>s});var t=o(96540);const i={},r=t.createContext(i);function a(e){const n=t.useContext(r);return t.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(n):{...n,...e}}),[n,e])}function s(e){let n;return n=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(i):e.components||i:a(e.components),t.createElement(r.Provider,{value:n},e.children)}}}]);
