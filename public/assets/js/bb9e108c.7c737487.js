However, modern technology can help mitigate this issue. With the integration of IoT sensors, AI-powered vision devices, and hive monitoring systems, beekeepers can detect early signs of robbing, such as unusual entrance activity or aggressive bee behavior. Real-time data allows for swift action to be taken, such as closing the entrance or relocating the hive, preventing a full-scale robbery. Innovations like these can dramatically reduce the risks posed by robbing and improve overall hive management, ensuring healthier and more productive colonies."})]})}function h(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,s.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,n.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,n.jsx)(b,{...e})}):b(e)}},28453:(e,t,o)=>{o.d(t,{R:()=>a,x:()=>i});var n=o(96540);const s={},r=n.createContext(s);function a(e){const t=n.useContext(r);return n.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function i(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(s):e.components||s:a(e.components),n.createElement(r.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
