Our IoT-enabled hive sensors and AI vision hive entrance devices can detect unusual hive activity, such as vibrations or sudden movement, and alert beekeepers in real-time to potential threats. Additionally, our robotic beehive designs incorporate sturdy materials and deterrent mechanisms to reduce the likelihood of bear damage.
