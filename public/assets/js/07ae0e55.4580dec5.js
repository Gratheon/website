Our AI-powered hive entrance monitoring device uses vision-based analytics to detect signs of heightened aggression, such as erratic flight patterns or increased defensive guarding. By pairing this with IoT sensors tracking environmental stressors, such as temperature, noise, or vibration near the hive, we help beekeepers identify triggers and respond proactively. For instance, replacing an overly aggressive queen with a docile strain can dramatically reduce defensive behavior. Additionally, our robotic beehive automates hive inspection and incorporates features to adjust hive conditions and reduce stress, like automated temperature regulation, protecting neighbors. With these tools, Gratheon empowers beekeepers to nurture healthier, more harmonious colonies in any setting."})]})}function h(e={}){const{wrapper:n}={...(0,s.R)(),...e.components};return n?(0,r.jsx)(n,{...e,children:(0,r.jsx)(u,{...e})}):u(e)}},28453:(e,n,t)=>{t.d(n,{R:()=>o,x:()=>a});var i=t(96540);const r={},s=i.createContext(r);function o(e){const n=i.useContext(s);return i.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(n):{...n,...e}}),[n,e])}function a(e){let n;return n=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(r):e.components||r:o(e.components),i.createElement(s.Provider,{value:n},e.children)}}}]);
