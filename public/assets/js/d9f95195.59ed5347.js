Combined with IoT sensors that track environmental conditions and hive health, our technologies provide non-invasive, data-driven insights into Varroa populations. By eliminating the need for alcohol washing, we aim to empower beekeepers with sustainable tools that prioritize the well-being of every bee, strengthening colonies against threats while preserving their vital role in our ecosystems."})]})}function d(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,o.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,n.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,n.jsx)(c,{...e})}):c(e)}},28453:(e,t,i)=>{i.d(t,{R:()=>a,x:()=>r});var n=i(96540);const o={},s=n.createContext(o);function a(e){const t=n.useContext(s);return n.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function r(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(o):e.components||o:a(e.components),n.createElement(s.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
