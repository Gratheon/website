This, in turn, weakens the colony, makes them more susceptible to pests like mites, and affects their ability to forage effectively.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"\ud83c\udf28\ufe0f Problems/\ud83d\uddc3\ufe0f Storm wind collapsing beehives":{"id":"\ud83c\udf28\ufe0f Problems/\ud83d\uddc3\ufe0f Storm wind collapsing beehives","title":"\ud83d\uddc3\ufe0f Storm wind collapsing beehives","description":"Flimsy beehives present a significant challenge for beekeepers, especially in regions where weather conditions are unpredictable and harsh. High winds can easily topple or push over a poorly constructed hive, leaving the colony vulnerable to cold temperatures. In these situations, the bees may not be able to regulate their environment, and the cold can quickly lead to the death of the colony. Additionally, beehives with wide or inadequately secured entrances can exacerbate the situation. When winds push air into the hive, it can chill the brood, weakening the colony and making it more susceptible to collapse. Beekeepers who fail to secure their hives may face catastrophic losses as the hive structure becomes compromised by the elements.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"\ud83c\udf28\ufe0f Problems/\ud83d\uddc3\ufe0f Ugly beehives":{"id":"\ud83c\udf28\ufe0f Problems/\ud83d\uddc3\ufe0f Ugly beehives","title":"\ud83d\uddc3\ufe0f Ugly beehives","description":"Many beekeepers face is the physical deterioration of their hives. Traditional wooden beehives often suffer from rotting or weakening, particularly in harsh weather conditions. The materials used to construct these hives\u2014such as wood, bricks, and even old tires as stands\u2014can be prone to damage and decay over time. Beekeepers may use bricks on the roof to prevent wind damage, but this makeshift solution can lead to added weight and unnecessary stress on the hive structure. Additionally, the use of asbestos roofing in older hives presents both health and environmental concerns, as it is harmful to both the bees and the beekeeper when deteriorated.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"\ud83c\udf28\ufe0f Problems/\ud83e\udd22 Pesticide poisoning":{"id":"\ud83c\udf28\ufe0f Problems/\ud83e\udd22 Pesticide poisoning","title":"\ud83e\udd22 Pesticide poisoning","description":"Problem","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"\ud83c\udf28\ufe0f Problems/\ud83e\udd80 Diseases":{"id":"\ud83c\udf28\ufe0f Problems/\ud83e\udd80 Diseases","title":"\ud83e\udd80 Diseases","description":"Beekeepers face numerous challenges when it comes to maintaining healthy hives, and one of the most pressing concerns is the prevalence of diseases, particularly viral and bacterial infections. Viruses such as Chronic Bee Paralysis Virus (CBPV), Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus (IAPV), and Lake Sinai Virus (LSV) pose significant threats to bee colonies. CBPV causes paralysis in adult bees, rendering them unable to fly or perform their essential tasks, which weakens the entire hive. IAPV and LSV are linked to colony collapse disorder (CCD), where the bees abandon the hive, leading to a rapid decline in population. Identifying and mitigating these viruses is crucial for ensuring the survival of bee colonies, as they have a direct impact on pollination and agricultural ecosystems.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"\ud83c\udf28\ufe0f Problems/\ud83e\udd80 Infestations":{"id":"\ud83c\udf28\ufe0f Problems/\ud83e\udd80 Infestations","title":"\ud83e\udd80 Infestations","description":"Beekeepers face numerous challenges when it comes to protecting their hives, with infestations of pests like Varroa destructor and Tropilaelaps mites being among the most detrimental. These parasitic mites invade beehives, feeding on the blood of honeybees, weakening the colony by spreading diseases such as deformed wing virus. The infestation often goes unnoticed until it has already caused severe damage, as the mites tend to remain hidden in brood cells. Without timely intervention, these mites can decimate entire hives, leading to significant losses for beekeepers and threatening pollination systems that are crucial to agriculture.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"\ud83c\udf28\ufe0f Problems/\ud83e\uddf6 Swarming":{"id":"\ud83c\udf28\ufe0f Problems/\ud83e\uddf6 Swarming","title":"\ud83e\uddf6 Swarming","description":"Swarming is one of the most significant challenges beekeepers face, as it occurs when a large group of bees leaves the hive to form a new colony, usually during the warmer months. This behavior is a natural process for bee reproduction, but it can lead to the loss of a substantial portion of the colony and disrupt honey production. Beekeepers often struggle to detect the early signs of swarming, such as increased queen cell formation or the hive becoming overcrowded, which makes it difficult to intervene in time. Without proper intervention, swarming can result in a weakened colony, reduced honey yield, and the need for the beekeeper to manage the new swarm.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"\ud83c\udf28\ufe0f Problems/\ud83d\ude9b Transport stress and risk":{"id":"\ud83c\udf28\ufe0f Problems/\ud83d\ude9b Transport stress and risk","title":"\ud83d\ude9b Transport stress and risk","description":"","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"\ud83c\udf3b Purpose/\ud83c\udf3b Purpose":{"id":"\ud83c\udf3b Purpose/\ud83c\udf3b Purpose","title":"\ud83c\udf3b Purpose","description":"Gratheon develops an open, modular, roboticbeehive as a data service for \ud83d\udc68\ud83c\udffb\u200d\ud83d\ude80 Semi-professional beekeepers to save bees \ud83d\udc1d, improve efficiency and increase food security through scalable precise pollination.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"\ud83c\udf3b Purpose/Company mission":{"id":"\ud83c\udf3b Purpose/Company mission","title":"Company mission","description":"How we treat the weakest, defines us.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"\ud83c\udf3b Purpose/Ethics":{"id":"\ud83c\udf3b Purpose/Ethics","title":"Ethics \u262f\ufe0f","description":"Ethics is a branch of philosophy that deals with the study of what is morally right or wrong, good or bad.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"\ud83c\udf3b Purpose/Naming":{"id":"\ud83c\udf3b Purpose/Naming","title":"Naming","description":"Company name has multiple meanings on different layers, so there is no definitive answer","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"\ud83c\udf3b Purpose/Symbolism":{"id":"\ud83c\udf3b Purpose/Symbolism","title":"Symbolism","description":"Colors represent main wavelengths that \ud83d\udc1d bees can see, company values and other associations:","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"\ud83d\udce2 Press kit":{"id":"\ud83d\udce2 Press kit","title":"\ud83d\udce2 Press kit","description":"Materials for press media coverage.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"company/\ud83c\udf70 Equity and fundraising plan":{"id":"company/\ud83c\udf70 Equity and fundraising plan","title":"\ud83c\udf70 Equity and fundraising plan","description":"\ud83d\udca1 This page is summarizing the long-term plan of the equity program for the employees, founders, investors and advisors.
