As drones consume the hive\u2019s resources without contributing, the colony can suffer from a lack of workers to forage, maintain hive structure, and care for the brood. Without intervention, the colony may eventually collapse. Identifying and replacing a drone-laying queen is a common remedy, but it requires keen observation and sometimes the use of specialized technology to monitor the health and dynamics of the hive. Advanced solutions, such as AI-powered hive monitoring tools and IoT sensors, can provide beekeepers with real-time data to identify such issues early, ensuring the timely management of the colony and preventing hive loss."})]})}function h(e={}){const{wrapper:n}={...(0,a.R)(),...e.components};return n?(0,i.jsx)(n,{...e,children:(0,i.jsx)(u,{...e})}):u(e)}}}]);
