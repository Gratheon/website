These monocultures often create \u201cfood deserts\u201d for pollinators, as they provide a single type of pollen and nectar for a short flowering period. Once that crop is harvested, bees face starvation or must rely on alternative sources that may not be present in the surrounding landscape. This lack of diverse, year-round forage weakens bee colonies, making them more susceptible to diseases, pests like the Varroa mite, and environmental stressors such as climate fluctuations. For beekeepers, this means higher costs to transport hives to better locations, supplement diets with sugar syrups, or invest in more frequent health interventions for their colonies."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"At Gratheon, we\u2019re tackling this issue by integrating advanced technology into hive management.

Additionally, our robotic beehive supports hive health with precise climate control and automated feeding systems, reducing the impact of environmental challenges. By combining smart tools with data-driven insights, we empower beekeepers to mitigate the effects of monocultural farming while advocating for more sustainable agricultural practices that support pollinator-friendly landscapes."})]})}function d(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,r.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,s.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,s.jsx)(u,{...e})}):u(e)}},28453:(e,t,o)=>{o.d(t,{R:()=>i,x:()=>a});var n=o(96540);const s={},r=n.createContext(s);function i(e){const t=n.useContext(r);return n.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function a(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(s):e.components||s:i(e.components),n.createElement(r.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
