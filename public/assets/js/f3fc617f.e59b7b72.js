By integrating IoT sensors, AI-powered vision systems, and robotics into our beekeeping solutions, we empower beekeepers to monitor hive health remotely and in real time. Our AI vision hive entrance device, for instance, observes bee behavior at the entrance to detect early warning signs of stress or disease. Meanwhile, IoT sensors inside the hive monitor temperature, humidity, and sound patterns, providing actionable insights without the need to disturb the bees. Together with our robotic hive, these innovations drastically reduce the need for manual inspections, freeing up valuable time for beekeepers and ensuring healthier, more productive colonies. Gratheon's solutions bring a new era of efficiency and sustainability to modern apiculture."})]})}function u(e={}){const{wrapper:n}={...(0,t.R)(),...e.components};return n?(0,s.jsx)(n,{...e,children:(0,s.jsx)(h,{...e})}):h(e)}},28453:(e,n,i)=>{i.d(n,{R:()=>r,x:()=>a});var s=i(96540);const t={},o=s.createContext(t);function r(e){const n=s.useContext(o);return s.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(n):{...n,...e}}),[n,e])}function a(e){let n;return n=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(t):e.components||t:r(e.components),s.createElement(o.Provider,{value:n},e.children)}}}]);
