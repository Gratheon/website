We\u2019ve had various hackathons and accelerators so far. The last one was http://prototron.ee/, where we got into top 25 out of 50 applicants.\n\nThe current status is - we have a web app that is open for anyone to register and try out at https://app.gratheon.com/.\n\nOur code and internal docs are fully open source, and you\u2019re encouraged to check them out on GitHub: https://github.com/Gratheon\n\n\nAs I understand you are located in Estonia, so you do have an advantage to collaborate physically on the prototype development. Though for that I would actually invite you to explore what you think is best that you can do for the project.\n\nYou can find a full list of ideas and features we have in the backlog:\nhttps://gratheon.notion.site/Solutions-ideas-features-ca76f493a1454e14b7dfbae7bd292a2e\n\nFeatures related to robotics for example:\n\n- Currently we\u2019re working on a video processing of the beehive entrance video stream, its not yet clear how to best process it on the edge IoT device and send telemetry and how the design should look like. Current state is described here - https://gratheon.notion.site/Design-Prototype-8fc6ea808b95434da228c48b6d195f12\n\n- This Beehive Gatehouse should have a sliding mechanism that would close entrance in case of hornet attack. Features are described here - https://gratheon.notion.site/Beehive-Gatehouse-b0319799ab7744dc928c08119de4fc43\n\n- For a full beehive robot we also have only a rough vision described here\nhttps://gratheon.notion.site/Robotic-Beehive-fd9559a2950b44bc8291972299ced18e\n\nIf you can help with designing that, that would help use greatly. We need competency with CAD, 3d modelling and wiring components together as well as programming it.\n\n- To make things more even more challenging, Beehive Apiary should be more complex and robot should be able to serve multiple hives, so it should be designed to move and able to open/close hives to keep bee colonies safe.\n\nOptionally, you can check out our past meeting recordings - https://gratheon.notion.site/All-hands-meeting-recordings-405d4ff10fc04cd4a57dc8ed9ef362a9?pvs=74\n\nAre you up for the challenge?
