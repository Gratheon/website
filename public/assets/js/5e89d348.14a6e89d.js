However, modern technology can help mitigate this issue. With the integration of IoT sensors, AI-powered vision devices, and hive monitoring systems, beekeepers can detect early signs of robbing, such as unusual entrance activity or aggressive bee behavior. Real-time data allows for swift action to be taken, such as closing the entrance or relocating the hive, preventing a full-scale robbery. Innovations like these can dramatically reduce the risks posed by robbing and improve overall hive management, ensuring healthier and more productive colonies."})]})}function h(e={}){const{wrapper:o}={...(0,i.R)(),...e.components};return o?(0,s.jsx)(o,{...e,children:(0,s.jsx)(b,{...e})}):b(e)}}}]);
