AFB is a highly contagious and fatal bacterial infection that affects the brood (larvae and pupae), leading to the destruction of entire colonies if not controlled. EFB is less severe but still compromises the health of the hive by killing larvae and making them susceptible to other diseases. Sacbrood and chalkbrood also target the brood, causing deformities and weakening the colony. These bacterial diseases often require careful management, including the use of antibiotics and isolation of affected hives, to prevent widespread outbreaks.
