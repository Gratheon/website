I assume your aim is to teach others about bees and beekeeping practices, learn something new with the technological products we are developing.\n\nJust wanted to reiterate that this is not a paid position. We're just getting the project started and our team is composed of volunteers, rather small (5-10) and not very formal. We\u2019ve had various hackathons and accelerators so far. The last one was prototron.ee where we got in the top 25 out of 50 teams.\n\nThe current status of the project is that we have a web-app written in react that is open for anyone to register and try out at https://app.gratheon.com/. Our code, datasets, internal docs are fully open source, and you\u2019re encouraged to check them out at https://github.com/Gratheon\n\nAs there are multiple candidates, and I'm not sure how best to evaluate you, so if you have time for such side project I suggest you to:\n\n1. Explore what you think about list of features we have in the backlog:\nhttps://gratheon.notion.site/Ideas-and-Features-ca76f493a1454e14b7dfbae7bd292a2e\n\n2. Join Discord to discuss a specific feature you could improve, which is not clear / not groomed yet or to discuss new idea or feature: https://discord.gg/PcbP4uedWj\n\n3. Work on the new UX with designers, explain it to engineers, have feature released in production, test it out, promote to other beekeepers - https://gratheon.notion.site/Onboarding-91481a8152cf4d1685770ec2a7cc7c94 .\n\n4. Optionally, you can check out our past meeting recordings - https://gratheon.notion.site/All-hands-meeting-recordings-405d4ff10fc04cd4a57dc8ed9ef362a9?pvs=74\n\nBasically we need more eyes on the products we are developing that its what beekeepers need. So if you can point what is important and whats needed, that would help us with the focus.\n\nFeel free to explore Notion and I hope to hear back from you in the Discord.\n"})})}function l(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,s.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,a.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,a.jsx)(u,{...e})}):u(e)}},28453:(e,t,o)=>{o.d(t,{R:()=>r,x:()=>i});var n=o(96540);const a={},s=n.createContext(a);function r(e){const t=n.useContext(s);return n.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function i(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(a):e.components||a:r(e.components),n.createElement(s.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
