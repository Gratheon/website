          <h3>11. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h3>
          <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track
            (&#34;DNT&#34;) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about
            your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for recognizing and
            implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or
            any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for
            online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a
            revised version of this Privacy Policy.</p>
