must,extract 8-10 frames per box
should,"allow manual extraction/replacement of specific frame by beekeeper, without opening the hive (for cross-family resource balancing, honey separation etc)"
should,take into account bee morphology for material design (bee’s grip)
should,"container box vary in size depending on frame size (langstroth, estonian, farrar, dadan etc)"

should,not have chemically/aroma active compounds (plastic) inside the hive
should,avoid (cold) metal exposed to bees inside the hive
should,keep hive internals at 50-60% humidity (ventilation on top)
should,design bee movements to be efficient while navigating inside the hive
should,do inspection without major interruption in colony life (one frame at a time)
should,not do inspections of the hive at cold (winter) time
should,have gradual lighting of the frame while taking a photo to not blind/affect bees
should,not risk bee healthy by having multiple colonies together in one congested space
