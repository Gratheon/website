## Installation

- Make sure to have host machine Ubuntu v22. Higher versions will not work with SDK
- Install Nvidia SDK manager
- Under Jetson CPU chip, connect `FC REC` and `GND` pins to run device in reset mode
- Connect USB-C port of the jetson with USB3 port of your host machine. Prefer fast cables, as USB-2 cable will be very slow
- Run Jetson
- Run NVidia SDK manager, that should detect the device
- Check almost all checkboxes
- After half of the installation is complete, SDK will ask about `IP` .
    - You now need to login into jetson (so connect display, mouse, keyboard)
    - Attach ethernet cable to jetson or connect via wifi. Run `ifconfig` and get its IP.
    - Make sure host machine and jetson are in the same network
    - In SDK manager, enter jetson IP so that it can install remaining software
