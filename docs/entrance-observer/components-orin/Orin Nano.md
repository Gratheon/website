## About this item

- The NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano Super Developer Kit is a compact, powerful computer that redefines generative AI for small edge devices. It delivers up to 67 TOPS of AI performance, a 1.7X improvement over its predecessor, to run vision transformers, large language models, and more. This affordable and accessible platform is supported by NVIDIA AI software and a broad ecosystem. Existing users can upgrade with just a software update, unlocking new possibilities in generative AI.
- The developer kit comprises a Jetson Orin Nano 8GB module and a reference carrier board that can accommodate all Orin Nano and Orin NX modules, providing an ideal platform for prototyping your next-gen edge AI product. The Jetson Orin Nano 8GB module features an Ampere GPU and a 6-core ARM CPU, enabling multiple concurrent AI application pipelines and high-performance inference. The carrier board boasts a wide array of connectors, including two MIPI CSI connectors supporting camera modules with up to 4-lanes, allowing higher resolution and frame rate than before.
- Jetson runs the NVIDIA AI software stack, with available use-case-specific application frameworks, including NVIDIA Isaac for robotics, NVIDIA Metropolis for vision AI, and NVIDIA Holoscan for sensor processing. You can save significant time with NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator for synthetic data generation (SDG), and with NVIDIA TAO Toolkit for fine-tuning pretrained AI models from the NGC catalog.
- Ecosystem partners offer additional AI and system software, developer tools, and custom software development. They can also help with cameras and other sensors, as well as carrier boards and design services for your product.
- Jetson Orin modules are unmatched in performance and efficiency for robots and other autonomous machines and give you the flexibility to create the next generation of AI solutions with the latest NVIDIA technology. Together with the world-standard NVIDIA AI software stack and an ecosystem of services and products, your road to market has never been faster.
