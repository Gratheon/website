- We use [Penpot](https://www.notion.so/Penpot-5b3ff5ada9be405ab76e524baed02279?pvs=21) for wireframes instead of figma because, its free
- After wireframe is complete, update Feature in[Ideas and Features](https://www.notion.so/Ideas-and-Features-ca76f493a1454e14b7dfbae7bd292a2e?pvs=21) so that its clear for everyone
- It does not have ability to share wireframe publicly, so you need an invite from @Артём Курапов
