**Product description**

The CJMCU-8118 is a gas sensor system-on-chip (SSoC) + temperature and humidity sensor that uses low-power sensing technology to detect indoor volatile organic compounds (VOCs).

From the schematic diagram of the CCS811 onboard the CJMCU8118, we can see that this is not a simple sensor. It also integrates an MCU inside, so that this sensor has on-board processing capabilities, which can provide etc. Effective carbon dioxide level or total volatile organic compound (TVOC) indicator. At the same time, compared to solutions using discrete gas sensors and MCUs, the CCS811 can save equipment bill-of-material costs and up to 60% of the board area.
