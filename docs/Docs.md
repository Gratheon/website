This section describes more technical guides that can help you setup own devices that can interact with Gratheon app if you choose to. These guides also document our architecture, services, code, reasons to choose one solution over another. 

If you are technical enough and find this useful, feel free to improve these guides in github or even add new ones. If you are not that technical, maybe buy ready devices and kits (once we have those available)

We document everything also for ourselves, following [Radiate truth 🌞](/about/company/Culture%20and%20values%20🫀/Radiate%20truth%20🌞) and [Observable mind 🧿](/about/company/Culture%20and%20values%20🫀/Observable%20mind%20🧿) values
