<ul>
<li class=""><strong>Filed:</strong> December 7, 2025 with Patendiamet (Estonian Patent Office)</li>
<li class=""><strong>Cost:</strong> €300 for 3 classes</li>
<li class=""><strong>Coverage:</strong> Estonia</li>
<li class=""><strong>Expected registration:</strong> Q2 2026 (2-3 months examination + 3 months opposition period)</li>
<li class=""><strong>Valid for:</strong> 10 years from registration</li>
<li class=""><strong>Renewal:</strong> 2036</li>
</ul>
<p>The ® symbol will be added to our branding once registration is confirmed. We're evaluating EU-wide filing (€1,000) as we scale beyond Estonian borders.</p>

<p>As we prepare for our €40k angel round and deploy IoT hardware to beekeepers in the field, having protected intellectual property:</p>
<ul>
<li class="">Strengthens investor confidence with formal IP</li>
<li class="">Prevents brand confusion in our home market</li>
<li class="">Establishes legal foundation for expansion (EU-wide filing considered as we scale)</li>
<li class="">Protects both hardware innovations and software services under one unified brand</li>
<li class="">Cost-effective approach: €300 for Estonian protection vs €1,000 for EU-wide</li>
</ul>
<p>While we maintain our open source philosophy for code (AGPL license), protecting the Gratheon brand ensures that our identity and market positioning remain distinct as we scale.</p>

<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Develop a comprehensive alerts system for beekeepers that monitors critical hive parameters and delivers actionable notifications.</p>
<p><strong>Core Features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li class=""><strong>Multi-source data integration:</strong> Real-time monitoring of hive weight and temperature via IoT sensors, plus bee activity detection through entrance cameras using computer vision</li>
<li class=""><strong>Intelligent alert engine:</strong> Both simple threshold-based alerts (weight loss &gt;2kg, temperature &gt;35°C) and AI-driven anomaly detection for complex behavioral patterns</li>
<li class=""><strong>Multi-channel notifications:</strong> Email and SMS delivery with customizable urgency levels and scheduling</li>
<li class=""><strong>Colony-specific configuration:</strong> Individual alert rules per hive with historical context and seasonal adjustments</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Goals:</strong> Enable proactive hive management by detecting critical events like swarming preparation, robbing attacks, varroa mite infestations, and environmental stress before they cause colony loss. The system transforms raw sensor data into actionable insights, reducing manual inspection frequency while improving colony survival rates.</p>
<p><strong>Target Users:</strong> Commercial beekeepers managing 10+ colonies who need scalable monitoring solutions.</p>

<p>Risk 1: Hardware Integration Complexity IoT sensors may have connectivity issues in outdoor conditions.</p>
<p>Mitigation: Implement error handling, offline buffering, and extensive field testing. Develop fallback alert systems using manual input.</p>
<p>Risk 2: Low Market Adoption Rate Beekeepers are conservative and may resist new technology.</p>
<p>Mitigation: Start with early adopters, create ROI case studies, offer freemium model, partner with beekeeping associations.</p>
<p>Risk 3: False Alert Accuracy Issues AI detection may produce false positives/negatives, damaging user trust.</p>
<p>Mitigation: Begin with reliable threshold alerts. Gradually introduce ML features with user feedback loops and confidence scoring.</p>

<p>Market Size: Europe: 13M colonies (EU27) with 20-25% annual losses. Middle East: Turkey 8M, Iran 6M colonies, 25-30% losses. Combined 27M colonies. U.S. crisis: record 60% commercial losses (2024-2025), up from 17.7-76.2% previous year - 1.7M colonies died.</p>
<p>Core Problem: Traditional beekeeping requires "hard, frequent, unscalable work" - weekly 20kg hive inspections in protective suits. European beekeepers managing cross-border apiaries cannot scale monitoring. U.S. winter losses: 40.2% (2024-2025). Varroa mites, viruses, pesticides drive crisis. Priority issues: observability (100%), unscalable operations (90%), overwintering collapse (80%).</p>
<p>Disruption Opportunity: European/Middle Eastern markets lack integrated solutions. Gratheon's IoT + computer vision + AI alerts transforms reactive to predictive management, potentially preventing 20-30% losses across 27M+ colonies during critical period.</p>

<p>Main Competitors: BeeHero (Israel) - IoT sensors lacking video integration. Beewise (Israel) -
400/month), expensive all-or-nothing model. Broodminder - hobbyist IoT with limited enterprise features. Purple Hive/ApicAI - basic entrance monitoring.</p>
<p>Key Differentiation: Only integrated platform combining IoT + video analysis + AI insights. Modular approach allows incremental adoption vs expensive robotic systems. AI-driven alerts detect complex behavioral patterns (swarming, pest intrusions) competitors miss.</p>
<p>Competitive Advantages: Real-time edge computer vision with published research. Serves underserved mid-market (10-100 hives) between hobbyist tools and enterprise robotics. Cost efficient: €300-800 hardware vs €15,000+ robotics. Only solution providing environmental + behavioral monitoring with AI correlation</p>

<p>Primary - Commercial Beekeepers (5-100 hives): Pollination services (90% income), honey secondary. Own specialized equipment, maintain warehouses, hire workers, use mobile apiaries. Pain points: scaling inspections, managing distant locations, preventing colony losses. Willingness: €200-500/month for proven ROI.</p>
<p>Secondary - Tech-Savvy Hobbyists: 1-10 hives seeking data insights. Motivated by bee welfare/learning over economics. Often engineers comfortable with technology. Value education and behavioral analysis. Price sensitivity: €50-150/month with ease-of-use focus.</p>
<p>Tertiary: Urban beekeepers (neighbor-friendly monitoring), farmers (pollination verification), research institutions (behavior studies), new beekeepers (guidance).</p>
<p>User Personas: Industrial operator (200+ hives, 5 locations) needs scalable monitoring. Semi-commercial (25 hives) wants early warnings. Tech enthusiast (5 hives) desires behavioral analytics</p>

<p>SaaS Tiers: Starter €15/month - web app, basic management, 10 hives (hobbyists). Professional €49/month - IoT integration, analytics, alerts, 50 hives (semi-commercial). Enterprise €149/month - unlimited hives, entrance observers, AI insights, priority support (commercial).</p>
<p>Hardware Revenue: IoT scales €300-400 (70% margins). Entrance cameras €600-800 (60% margins). Installation €50-100/deployment.</p>
<p>Projections: Year 1: 40 customers (€25 ARPU) = €12K ARR. Year 2: 150 customers (€35 ARPU) = €63K ARR. Year 3: 400 customers (€45 ARPU) = €216K ARR. Hardware: 100 units/year by Year 2 = €40K.</p>
<p>ROI Justification: Preventing single colony loss ($200-500) justifies annual subscription. Reduced labor (2 hours/hive/month at €20/hour) = €480 savings/hive. 5-hive operation: €2,400 savings vs €588 Professional cost = 300% ROI.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Had a meeting with <a href="https://vidrik.taltech.ee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">VIRUMAA DIGI- JA ROHETEHNOLOOGIATE INNOVATSIOONIKESKUS</a> representatives (engineers, researchers and managers) on the topic of research and development collaboration with Gratheon. Seems like the most suitable topic is the area of IoT devices.</p>
<p>We talked about the project and its market, past experience of the team, funding sources, some technical details.</p>
<p>Specifically</p>
<ul>
<li class="">local team used nrf9160 chip (instead of esp32) to be more energy efficient</li>
<li class="">MQTT and GSM were brought up as possible communication means for the device</li>
<li class=""><a href="https://tradex.ee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="https://tradex.ee/" class="">https://tradex.ee/</a> was used as a partner to make devices more prod ready (electronics)</li>
<li class="">nokia dynanet - as a construction example of expandable frames and nest was brought up  for robotic beehive construction</li>
<li class="">we should have a small research paper abstract published</li>
</ul>

<p>Short live data: In order to have detailed data about closest meteostation, we would need to do a lot of work by crawling the site, downloading all files, parsing them to extract windSpeed for example. And to keep data up to date we would need to do this over and over in a loop, which would add too much load on Keskkonnaagentuur servers</p>

<ul>
<li class="">granularity is too broad - it is split into day and night, instead of hourly</li>
<li class="">its forecasts only 4 days</li>
<li class="">its tied to key regions, not coordinates</li>
<li class="">regions are forecasted only for 1 day ahead, the rest is considered the same for all regions</li>
<li class="">it does not always have wind speed property, even though text description has one</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="">
<p>Climate data time series API shows past data, but not future forecast.

<p>We had to re-write API handling, because data nesting was
<code>day -&gt; data</code> instead of <code>data -&gt; time</code> which we needed for charts in UI to plot the data</p>

</li>
<li class="">
<p>We decided to show both the react app prototype that will have full vision of what we intend to do, as well as mention that we have production ready service using real API</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://gratheon.com/assets/images/Screenshot%202024-11-30%20at%2011.27.14-4f53914eabf00c924871c094294a5fe1.png" width="1360" height="1410" class="img_Uobs"></p>

<li class="">later we found another API <a href="https://ilmmicroservice.envir.ee/api_doc/#api-Forecasts-GetV1ForecastsModelforecastbylocation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">https://ilmmicroservice.envir.ee/api_doc/#api-Forecasts-GetV1ForecastsModelforecastbylocation</a> that could be used for weather data. Although further discussion with mentors proved that this is somewhat private API that may change and using XML is best for now</li>
<li class="">We were practicing the pitch scenario and decided to show both the react app prototype to show off what is the vision as well as show that we did integrate real API into existing Gratheon web-app and weather microservice</li>
<li class="">We considered questions on marketing and sales (like that we target semi-professional beekeepers)</li>
<li class="">We've updated the UI prototype to have better highlighting of the danger zones</li>
<li class="">For the pitch, we configured twilio API to send SMS to all of the mentors/judges to effectively share our demo</li>

<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_rb2N" id="alert-use-case">Alert use case<a href="https://gratheon.com/blog/2024/11/29/%20%F0%9F%9B%A0%EF%B8%8F%20Andmetorm%20hackathon#alert-use-case" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Alert use case" title="Direct link to Alert use case" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<ul>
<li class="">Gratheon web-app monitors beekeepers apiaries and dangerous weather that can affect bees</li>
<li class="">When there is a storm or a heatwave approaching the apiary, web-app generates an alert</li>
<li class="">If user has entered the phone in the user profile and allowed us to contact him over the phone, we send an SMS</li>
<li class="">User (beekeeper) receives an SMS alert on the phone with a URL to relevant apiary</li>
<li class="">User opens apiary view, sees there is an alert details about high temperature (heat wave coming) or a high wind, when exactly it is expected and how dangerous it is</li>
<li class="">User reads an advice of what he needs to do, for example in case of storm - limit hive entrance, tie together hive with a rope</li>
</ul>

<p>Idea is to not only collect weather data when user opens the view or not only to predict data in advance, but also collect past weather information for specific apiary location.</p>
<p>This is needed so that beekeeper or AI model could correlate weather effects affecting the bees. For example, if there was 2 weeks of daily rain, then bees may be grounded and lose resources (pollen, nectar) which will be seen on hive weight graph too</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_rb2N" id="result">Result<a href="https://gratheon.com/blog/2024/11/29/%20%F0%9F%9B%A0%EF%B8%8F%20Andmetorm%20hackathon#result" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Result" title="Direct link to Result" translate="no">​</a></h2>
<p>We competed with 15 other teams and we did not win. Teams presented various solutions, winners suggested solutions with ESG and general data analysis that judges likely found to best fit judgement criterias and what Keskkonnaagentuur needed.</p>
<p>We had hands-on work on SMS alerting channels, weather APIs and more attractive UI for charts that will not go to waste. We shared the awareness of the product and did some networking.</p>]]></content:encoded>
