Combined with IoT sensors that track environmental conditions and hive health, our technologies provide non-invasive, data-driven insights into Varroa populations. By eliminating the need for alcohol washing, we aim to empower beekeepers with sustainable tools that prioritize the well-being of every bee, strengthening colonies against threats while preserving their vital role in our ecosystems."})]})}function m(e={}){let{wrapper:t}={...(0,s.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,o.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,o.jsx)(c,{...e})}):c(e)}},18439(e,t,i){i.d(t,{R:()=>a,x:()=>r});var n=i(30758);let o={},s=n.createContext(o);function a(e){let t=n.useContext(s);return n.useMemo(function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}},[t,e])}function r(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(o):e.components||o:a(e.components),n.createElement(s.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
