However, modern technology can help mitigate this issue. With the integration of IoT sensors, AI-powered vision devices, and hive monitoring systems, beekeepers can detect early signs of robbing, such as unusual entrance activity or aggressive bee behavior. Real-time data allows for swift action to be taken, such as closing the entrance or relocating the hive, preventing a full-scale robbery. Innovations like these can dramatically reduce the risks posed by robbing and improve overall hive management, ensuring healthier and more productive colonies."})]})}function h(e={}){let{wrapper:t}={...(0,i.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,s.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,s.jsx)(b,{...e})}):b(e)}},18439(e,t,o){o.d(t,{R:()=>a,x:()=>r});var n=o(30758);let s={},i=n.createContext(s);function a(e){let t=n.useContext(i);return n.useMemo(function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}},[t,e])}function r(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(s):e.components||s:a(e.components),n.createElement(i.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
