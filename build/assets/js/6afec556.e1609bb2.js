Our IoT-enabled hive sensors and AI vision hive entrance devices can detect unusual hive activity, such as vibrations or sudden movement, and alert beekeepers in real-time to potential threats. Additionally, our robotic beehive designs incorporate sturdy materials and deterrent mechanisms to reduce the likelihood of bear damage. By combining proactive monitoring and robust hive architecture, we aim to protect bee colonies and empower beekeepers to focus on nurturing their hives without constant fear of wildlife interference."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:(0,s.jsx)(t.img,{src:n(88301).A+"",width:"768",height:"1024"})}),"\n",(0,s.jsxs)(t.p,{children:["photo - ",(0,s.jsx)(t.a,{href:"https://www.facebook.com/groups/108065015894483/user/100012526968833/?__cft__%5B0%5D=AZX7fuPj287Ey5NUgGC2KGvmjI0c5VauYoXa120HPUbyoWAdc7gBe0kp0KmQ740ohZS1GKfftyOusItALgpxnWlh4eyUrR-GP-x-6InFjg68VSG7Gvp9HOs2ddxfJH1Pkv1XtJSAjBnZErFTV8aTZBVs5ozfoKkTpu3NL9prtSpZJGNjOYEkNZSEfTmw8QrPcxE&__tn__=%2CP-R",children:"Kristo Hiiu"})]}),"\n",(0,s.jsxs)(t.p,{children:[(0,s.jsx)(t.img,{src:n(89333).A+"",width:"768",height:"1024"}),"photo - ",(0,s.jsx)(t.a,{href:"https://www.facebook.com/groups/108065015894483/user/100012526968833/?__cft__%5B0%5D=AZX7fuPj287Ey5NUgGC2KGvmjI0c5VauYoXa120HPUbyoWAdc7gBe0kp0KmQ740ohZS1GKfftyOusItALgpxnWlh4eyUrR-GP-x-6InFjg68VSG7Gvp9HOs2ddxfJH1Pkv1XtJSAjBnZErFTV8aTZBVs5ozfoKkTpu3NL9prtSpZJGNjOYEkNZSEfTmw8QrPcxE&__tn__=%2CP-R",children:"Kristo Hiiu"})]})]})}function h(e={}){let{wrapper:t}={...(0,o.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,s.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,s.jsx)(d,{...e})}):d(e)}},89333(e,t,n){n.d(t,{A:()=>i});let i=n.p+"assets/images/396714609_1790463771381171_6376395098469256205_n-9860cba9e91d135b137335d2deedcfd5.jpg"},88301(e,t,n){n.d(t,{A:()=>i});let i=n.p+"assets/images/396936600_1790463728047842_2700506079401733521_n-3c8f3aa4775f60590ce59913e471290d.jpg"},18439(e,t,n){n.d(t,{R:()=>a,x:()=>r});var i=n(30758);let s={},o=i.createContext(s);function a(e){let t=i.useContext(o);return i.useMemo(function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}},[t,e])}function r(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(s):e.components||s:a(e.components),i.createElement(o.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
