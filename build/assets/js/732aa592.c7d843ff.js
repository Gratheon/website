With IoT sensors and AI-driven monitoring, beekeepers can track hive weight, nectar flow, and weather conditions in real time, allowing them to anticipate potential starvation risks. Our robotic beehive offers automated feeding systems that can supplement natural resources during food shortages. By combining data-driven insights with proactive interventions, Gratheon empowers beekeepers to maintain healthier colonies, ensuring pollinators thrive even in challenging environments. Through these technologies, we aim to address the root causes of starvation and promote sustainable beekeeping practices."})]})}function d(e={}){let{wrapper:t}={...(0,a.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,i.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,i.jsx)(u,{...e})}):u(e)}},18439(e,t,o){o.d(t,{R:()=>s,x:()=>r});var n=o(30758);let i={},a=n.createContext(i);function s(e){let t=n.useContext(a);return n.useMemo(function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}},[t,e])}function r(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(i):e.components||i:s(e.components),n.createElement(a.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
