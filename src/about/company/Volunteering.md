## How to start

You can contribute by following these steps:

- [**Join our discord**](https://discord.gg/PcbP4uedWj)
- Pick a feature [Ideas and Features](https://www.notion.so/Ideas-and-Features-ca76f493a1454e14b7dfbae7bd292a2e?pvs=21) if you want to work on a large, full-stack part of the product. A feature requires product thinking and multiple expertises - UX, Frontend, Backend, DB, ML. Its a [**T**eam effort](https://www.notion.so/Team-effort-946788035d7f4462b4228eee8a4ca7ca?pvs=21)
    - In large companies features are maintained by product managers
- Alternatively, pick a task from [Tasks](https://www.notion.so/Tasks-67cbebc3a13c4fb3b8ac3396b4d03af4?pvs=21) if you want to work on internal, infrastructural task or a feature improvement. Tasks are more specialized.
    - In large companies tasks are managed by a team in JIRA. We don‚Äôt use JIRA currently. We tried github issues but those add extra friction.
- Ask for more information in discord to get attention and document more information for the feature as part of [Features (prioritized and incomplete)](https://www.notion.so/Features-prioritized-and-incomplete-0ccc5a51879941eb8b6f220c261be046?pvs=21)
    - We use Discord (specialized #layer-* channels for discussion to resolve blockers) and Notion to link results, knowledge and documentation.
- Follow [Engineering Onboarding](https://www.notion.so/Engineering-Onboarding-91481a8152cf4d1685770ec2a7cc7c94?pvs=21)
- Think ahead how your contribution will look like. We use different software [Internal tools & cloud services](https://www.notion.so/Internal-tools-cloud-services-2f74cf6da2854e03986c6de7bda3551a?pvs=21) to host results

## Why to volunteer

Volunteering means you work for free, because you‚Äôre **motivated** by other things:

- Believing in [Company Mission](https://www.notion.so/Company-Mission-e052619834d4474793e15f95dba6dd04?pvs=21), trying to help the üêù¬†bees
- Learning something new in the area that you are not yet familiar with (ex. IoT if you are a web developer)
- Having more freedom of trying oneself in different [](https://www.notion.so/d961012e6fc04f329b876179617803d8?pvs=21)compared to an established enterprise where entry barrier is so high (ex. trying to be an engineer if you are a PM)
- Sharpening your skills in engineering with a new tech
- Gaining open-source proof of experience you can use at applying to other jobs & positions (ex. creating CAD model)
- Teaching others if you are experienced in one area (ex. ML to backend engineers)

## Lower expectations, lower entry barrier

As we are in volunteer mode, its expected that people are contributing with different levels of their `activity`. So if you collaborate with others, do not expect much. People may suddenly disappear due to personal reasons (family, work, study etc). Its natural. [**A**dapt to change](https://www.notion.so/Adapt-to-change-0120570929b4435b85fc70bb12b43bf6?pvs=21)

### Contributions

Because of this, **short and atomic contributions as artifacts** are important both to the community as to the contributor. Contribution [**G**ather value](https://www.notion.so/Gather-value-77aab01281814dec94ccddf330619a23?pvs=21) into the product for the customer.

Contribution is:

- a github commit
- a file, image, cad model etc. shared with us
- contribution must have a permissive license for us to reuse the work
- documenting or clarifying a feature in Notion
    - recording a youtube video how thing is working

Thus _asking_ for information is not a contribution ;)

- See examples of contributions
    
    A github pull-request to an existing repository or a new repository that we can fork is one way to show your results. Examples - [backend services](https://github.com/Gratheon/telemetry-api/pull/9), [CAD models](https://github.com/Gratheon/hardware-robotic-beehive/pull/3)

## Communication

If Discord is not enough, we also try to have weekly meetings over google meet. Its free form, but we try to record meetings into [All-hands meeting recordings](https://www.notion.so/All-hands-meeting-recordings-405d4ff10fc04cd4a57dc8ed9ef362a9?pvs=21) and stream it to [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/tot_ra).

Be [**H**umbly kind](https://www.notion.so/Humbly-kind-27a696347d664de28b9f1504c79a16b7?pvs=21).

### Acknowledgement

If you are a contributor, we try to highlight this.

- you get a üü° yellow name if you _contributed_ some code to common namespace
- you are seen in github repository if you are a contributor
- your name remains in Notion tasks if you contributed to it

If you stick around for a long while and do the hard work today, you get a promise to get compensated in the future based on [Equity & fundraising program plan](https://www.notion.so/Equity-fundraising-program-plan-7ded807f758c405c84fc03aa1e3d91b2?pvs=21), as it is in company interest to keep the talent
