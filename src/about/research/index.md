We want to be aware of recent and historical development in research. Here we track publications that are most relevant.

An good overview is presented in [[Machine Learning and Computer Vision Techniques in Bee Monitoring Applications](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.00085.pdf)]([https://www.notion.so/Machine-Learning-and-Computer-Vision-Techniques-in-Bee-Monitoring-Applications-9935a742aff04940b207a7932b6b1ed5?pvs=21](https://www.notion.so/Machine-Learning-and-Computer-Vision-Techniques-in-Bee-Monitoring-Applications-9935a742aff04940b207a7932b6b1ed5?pvs=21))
