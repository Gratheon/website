> Ethics is a branch of philosophy that deals with the study of what is **morally** right or wrong, good or bad.

Ethics goes beyond current legal status.

It involves the examination of moral principles, values, and rules that govern human behavior and the justification of those principles. Ethics explores questions about how individuals should behave, what actions are considered virtuous or morally acceptable, and what principles should guide decision-making in various situations.

**Equity and Access:**

**Transparency and Education**

We should be transparent about the functioning of the technology, providing comprehensive information to beekeepers and stakeholders. Educational resources should be available to ensure beekeepers understand and can work effectively with the robotic system.

**Human-Bee Interaction and labour**

Does the robotic system support and enhance the role of beekeepers or replace them?

Robotic technology complements the work of beekeepers, empowering them with tools for better hive management and productivity
