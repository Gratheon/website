## Mark Hive as Collapsed

This feature allows users to mark a hive as collapsed, recording the date and cause of the colony's demise. This information is valuable for tracking colony losses and generating reports.

### How to Mark a Hive as Collapsed

1.  Navigate to the **Hive Edit View** for the specific hive you wish to mark.
2.  Locate and click the "Mark as Collapsed" button.
3.  A modal window will appear.
4.  In the modal, enter the **Cause of Collapse** (e.g., "Queen failure", "Pesticide exposure", "Winter loss").
5.  Confirm the details in the modal.

### Viewing Collapsed Hives

Once a hive is marked as collapsed, its status is updated. In the **Apiary List View** and **Hive List View**, collapsed hives will be visually indicated to distinguish them from active hives. This may include a specific icon or different styling.

### Reporting

The date a hive is marked as collapsed is recorded and can be used for generating annual reports on colony losses.
