The ® symbol will be added to our branding once registration is confirmed by EUIPO.

## Why Now

As we prepare for our €40k angel round and deploy IoT hardware to beekeepers in the field, having protected intellectual property:
- Strengthens investor confidence
- Prevents brand confusion in competitive markets
- Establishes legal foundation for international expansion
- Protects both hardware innovations and software services under one unified brand

While we maintain our open source philosophy for code (AGPL license), protecting the Gratheon brand ensures that our identity and market positioning remain distinct as we scale.
