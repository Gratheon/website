We're pitching to Tehnopol our project

1. 1min for your elevator pitch+team introduction
2. 1min for your business plan
3. 1min for the 6-month plan, what you would like to achieve during the AI Accelerator program, please divide your steps month by month


## AI Accelerator plan

Generally our goal is to make Gratheon more **production- and GTM ready** (eg. first paying customers!)

Splitting by products and services, our top priorities that we want to solve within these 6 months are:

### Entrance observer
- build a working pipeline for bee counting on the edge (nvidia orin)
  https://github.com/Gratheon/entrance-observer/issues/2
  https://github.com/Gratheon/entrance-observer/issues/6
- Send telemetry API to web-app
- Display counts it in web-app
- Validate that inferencing is realtime
  https://github.com/Gratheon/entrance-observer/issues/8

This should allow us to offer a product (entrance camera + GPU) and service for sale while making smallest development effort.

This will also be an example for future iterations/devices to 


Web-app:
- improve queen detection from photos
- solve AI model stability (depends on infrastructure) 


IoT sensors device:
- add prophet model to predict future hive weight
- add alerting in case of anomalies (sudden loss of )


## Expectations from AI Accelerator
- Receive mentorship on AI topics
