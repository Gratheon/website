# Tehnopol AI Accelerator Pitch

We're pitching Gratheon to Tehnopol's AI Accelerator program with the following structure:

1. 1min for elevator pitch + team introduction
2. 1min for business plan
3. 1min for 6-month plan, detailing what we aim to achieve during the AI Accelerator program (month by month)

## AI Accelerator Plan

Our primary goal is to make Gratheon **production- and GTM ready** (securing first paying customers!) by focusing on targeted product development.

We've divided our 6-month plan into three key product areas, allocating 2 months to each:

### IoT Sensors Device (Months 1-2)

- Implement configurable alerting for anomalies (e.g., sudden weight loss)
  - Add SMS alerting channel via Twilio integration
- Integrate [Prophet AI model](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) to predict future hive weight based on:
  - Historical weight data
  - Weather data
  - Entrance observer bee counts
  - Potential future application: bee colony demography forecasting

> **Why**: This AI-driven approach differentiates us from existing IoT solutions in the beekeeping market and adds significant value for beekeepers.

### Web Application (Months 3-4)

- Enhance queen detection from frame photos
  - Current limitation: Clarifai-trained model with small dataset and suboptimal precision
- Resolve AI model stability issues (resource constraints)
  - Evaluate Clarifai cloud hosting
  - Test models on our own infrastructure
  - Optimize for CPU usage
- Fix queen toggling functionality
- Improve basic statistics display and data visualization

> **Why**: These improvements will increase the value proposition for customers who manage apiaries through frame photos, providing meaningful statistics and insights that drive initial customer acquisition.

### Entrance Observer (Months 5-6)

- Build a working pipeline for bee counting on the edge (NVIDIA Orin)
  - Reference: [Issue #2](https://github.com/Gratheon/entrance-observer/issues/2)
  - Reference: [Issue #6](https://github.com/Gratheon/entrance-observer/issues/6)
- Develop telemetry API integration with web application
- Implement real-time count display in web interface
- Validate real-time inferencing capabilities
  - Reference: [Issue #8](https://github.com/Gratheon/entrance-observer/issues/8)

> **Why**: This creates a new product offering (entrance camera + GPU) with minimal development effort, while establishing a foundation for future iterations on more cost-effective and energy-efficient devices (ESP32 cam, Raspberry Pi).

## Expectations from AI Accelerator

- Refine product value proposition and messaging
- Improve business model (pricing strategy, GTM approach, unit economics)
- Technical guidance for AI implementation (addressing the challenges outlined above)
- Intellectual property support (logo design, trademark registration)
- Preparation for investor due diligence
- Community engagement and networking opportunities
