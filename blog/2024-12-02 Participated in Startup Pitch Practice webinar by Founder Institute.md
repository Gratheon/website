We took part in [Founder Institute](https://fi.co/) online 1 min pitch practicing and getting feedback from the mentors. [Regine Harr](https://www.linkedin.com/in/regine-harr-91012215/) gave a good advice on elevator pitch structure.

We now have shorter and more emotional [elevator pitch](https://gratheon.com/about/%F0%9F%8C%BB%20Purpose/#elevator-pitch) structure. We tested it on other mentors and got positive feedback.

We got questioned by [Dr. Raashid Saiyed](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raashidsaiyed/) on [why we are open source](../about/company/ðŸ¤²%20Why%20open%20source.md), [ðŸ“Š Market analysis](../about/company/ðŸ“Š%20Market%20analysis.md) and
