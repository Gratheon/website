Had a meeting with [VIRUMAA DIGI- JA ROHETEHNOLOOGIATE INNOVATSIOONIKESKUS](https://vidrik.taltech.ee/) representatives (engineers, researchers and managers) on the topic of research and development collaboration with Gratheon. Seems like the most suitable topic is the area of IoT devices.

We talked about the project and its market, past experience of the team, funding sources, some technical details.

Specifically
- local team used nrf9160 chip (instead of esp32) to be more energy efficient
- MQTT and GSM were brought up as possible communication means for the device
- [https://tradex.ee/](https://tradex.ee/ "https://tradex.ee/") was used as a partner to make devices more prod ready (electronics)
- nokia dynanet - as a construction example of expandable frames and nest was brought up  for robotic beehive construction
- we should have a small research paper abstract published
