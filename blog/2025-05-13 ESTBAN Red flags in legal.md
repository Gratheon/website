## Summary, legal aspects

- check statistics. check what are the avg rounds. wether offer is ok or not
- term sheets usually are not binding
	- teams not understanding what they are signing is dangerous. 
		- for example liquidation preference with 3x = everything goes to investors
		- new investors can be more control/agressive than older ones
- Due Diligence - don't hide anything. Otherwise later on you can be liable for that
- Convertibles / SAFEs. Difference. 95% are done on convertible loans in Estonia
	- Convertible loan = loan. In balance sheet it goes under obligation.
		- Section usually has maturity date if its converting or repayment.
		- Pre-money formula
	- With SAFE you usually need to repay. In some cases can be booked under equity.
		- Post-money formulas
	- Use same templates for different rounds
		- Ex. Startup Estonia. 
- Warranties - need to notify investors in case of internal issues (hiring/employees)
- Reverse vesting - ability to buy-out one of the not efficient founders. Vesting provisions.
- Non-competition. Protection against founder competing
- Roles for investors/leadership
	- Management board member = super power to manage company 
	- Supervisory board member = controlling body. Controls management, some veto rights
	- Observer = no voting rights. Tool for investors to get information.
- Management Board Member Service Agreement - more flexible. No non-competition payments. Employment Contract does.
- Liquidation preference - in EU. Investors 1x liquidation preference is ok.
- Anti-dilution protection. In case of down-rounds, investors get more.
