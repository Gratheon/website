We want to be aware of recent and historical development in research that is tied to bees, observability and machine learning. We are open to collaboration with research and academic institutions (see our docs for more engineering and ML specific articles). 

Here we track research papers that are most relevant. For practical and commercial projects see [Competition](Competition/Competition.md)

## Research collaboration with us

- [Tartu University](https://topics.cs.ut.ee/?language=en) - We are open to consulting on bachelor and master degrees work
- TalTech / Vidrik - we have collaborated on a [whitepaper](https://easychair.org/publications/preprint/QGJN)
