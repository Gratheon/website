  "description": "Beekeeping, while rewarding, is a labor-intensive practice, and one of the most time-consuming aspects is hive inspection. Traditional inspections require beekeepers to open hives manually, often disrupting the bees' natural activities and exposing them to environmental stressors. Each inspection involves checking for signs of pests, diseases, and overall colony health, a task that demands both expertise and hours of meticulous work. For larger apiaries, this process can quickly become overwhelming, leading to delays in addressing critical issues. Missing early signs of problems such as Varroa mite infestations or poor queen health can have devastating consequences for the colony, further complicating the beekeeper's already demanding responsibilities.",
