  "description": "Beekeeping is an age-old craft that plays a critical role in pollination and food production. Yet, for aspiring beekeepers, the journey to start their first hive can be daunting. The steep learning curve, upfront costs for equipment, and lack of access to hands-on guidance often discourage newcomers. Mismanaging a hive can lead to issues like colony collapse, diseases, or aggressive behavior, further intimidating beginners. With bees facing global threats such as habitat loss and pesticides, it’s essential to make beekeeping more accessible to support pollinator populations.",
