  "description": "Beekeepers worldwide face a persistent challenge in maintaining the health of their colonies: accurately monitoring Varroa mite infestations. These parasitic mites are a major threat to honeybee populations, weakening colonies by feeding on developing bees and spreading viruses. To assess the level of infestation, many beekeepers rely on alcohol wash tests, a method that involves shaking a sample of bees in alcohol to separate and count the mites. While this method is highly effective in determining mite loads, it comes at the cost of sacrificing hundreds of bees from the hive—a practice that many beekeepers find distressing and counterproductive to their conservation efforts.",
