  "description": "A colony without a queen is one of the most significant challenges beekeepers face, as the queen plays a crucial role in maintaining the hive's population and overall health. Without a queen, the hive becomes queenless and cannot reproduce worker bees, leading to a decline in the workforce. Over time, this reduces the hive's ability to gather food, care for brood, and defend itself from pests. Queenless hives often experience confusion and stress, which can make the colony vulnerable to disease, robbing, or even collapse. The beekeeper must either introduce a new queen or allow the bees to raise a new one, which can be time-consuming and complex.",
