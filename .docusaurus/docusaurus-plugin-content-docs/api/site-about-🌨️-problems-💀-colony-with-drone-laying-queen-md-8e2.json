  "description": "One significant challenge beekeepers face is the occurrence of a colony with a drone-laying queen. This abnormal situation arises when a queen bee begins laying unfertilized eggs, which develop into drones—male bees that are unable to contribute to the colony's honey production or survival. A drone-laying queen typically results from poor genetics, stress, or aging. Beekeepers can find themselves in a precarious situation because drone-laying queens fail to produce the necessary worker bees, which are critical for maintaining hive productivity and health.",
