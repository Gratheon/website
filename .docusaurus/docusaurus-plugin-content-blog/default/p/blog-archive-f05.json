Otherwise later on you can be liable for that\n- Convertibles / SAFEs. Difference. 95% are done on convertible loans in Estonia\n\t- Convertible loan = loan. In balance sheet it goes under obligation.\n\t\t- Section usually has maturity date if its converting or repayment.\n\t\t- Pre-money formula\n\t- With SAFE you usually need to repay. In some cases can be booked under equity.\n\t\t- Post-money formulas\n\t- Use same templates for different rounds\n\t\t- Ex. Startup Estonia. \n- Warranties - need to notify investors in case of internal issues (hiring/employees)\n- Reverse vesting - ability to buy-out one of the not efficient founders. Vesting provisions.\n- Non-competition. Protection against founder competing\n- Roles for investors/leadership\n\t- Management board member = super power to manage company \n\t- Supervisory board member = controlling body. Controls management, some veto rights\n\t- Observer = no voting rights. Tool for investors to get information.\n- Management Board Member Service Agreement - more flexible. No non-competition payments. Employment Contract does.\n- Liquidation preference - in EU. Investors 1x liquidation preference is ok.\n- Anti-dilution protection. In case of down-rounds, investors get more.\n\n![](img/Screenshot%202025-05-13%20at%2014.10.05.png)\n\n<!--truncate-->\n\n\n![](img/Screenshot%202025-05-13%20at%2014.39.02.png)\n![](img/Screenshot%202025-05-13%20at%2014.40.49.png)\n- Copyright protects software. In most jurisdiction exists by default, no need of explicit registration.\n\t- economic rights\n\t- moral rights (Europe included)\n- Trademarks distinguish your work from others. Registered. Specific to territories & goods/services categories.\n- Inventions - can be protected via patents. Specific to territories. Must be globally new. Possible to spoil it by showing in a trade show market. 6 month grace time.\n\t- processes\n\t- mechanisms\n\t- materials\n- Designs - external appearance of produceable goods. UX. Registration/territory based\n- Trade secrets - labeled info as confidential. NDAs in staff agreements. Encryption. Enforcing clean desk policies.

event","permalink":"/blog/2025/02/20/ üí∂ Tehnopol AI pre-accelerator event"}},"content":"We're pitching Gratheon to Tehnopol's AI Accelerator program with the following structure:\n\n1. 1min for elevator pitch + team introduction\n2. 1min for business plan\n3. 1min for 6-month plan, detailing what we aim to achieve during the AI Accelerator program (month by month)\n\n## AI Accelerator Plan\n\nOur primary goal is to make Gratheon **production- and GTM ready** (securing first paying customers!) by focusing on targeted product development.\n\nWe've divided our 6-month plan into three key product areas, allocating 2 months to each:\n\n### IoT Sensors Device (Months 1-2)\n\n- Implement configurable alerting for anomalies (e.g., sudden weight loss)\n  - Add SMS alerting channel via Twilio integration\n- Integrate [Prophet AI model](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) to predict future hive weight based on:\n  - Historical weight data\n  - Weather data\n  - Entrance observer bee counts\n  - Potential future application: bee colony demography forecasting\n\n> **Why**: This AI-driven approach differentiates us from existing IoT solutions in the beekeeping market and adds significant value for beekeepers.\n\n### Web Application (Months 3-4)\n\n- Enhance queen detection from frame photos\n  - Current limitation: Clarifai-trained model with small dataset and suboptimal precision\n- Resolve AI model stability issues (resource constraints)\n  - Evaluate Clarifai cloud hosting\n  - Test models on our own infrastructure\n  - Optimize for CPU usage\n- Fix queen toggling functionality\n- Improve basic statistics display and data visualization\n\n> **Why**: These improvements will increase the value proposition for customers who manage apiaries through frame photos, providing meaningful statistics and insights that drive initial customer acquisition.\n\n### Entrance Observer (Months 5-6)\n\n- Build a working pipeline for bee counting on the edge (NVIDIA Orin)\n  - Reference: [Issue #2](https://github.com/Gratheon/entrance-observer/issues/2)\n  - Reference: [Issue #6](https://github.com/Gratheon/entrance-observer/issues/6)\n- Develop telemetry API integration with web application\n- Implement real-time count display in web interface\n- Validate real-time inferencing capabilities\n  - Reference: [Issue #8](https://github.com/Gratheon/entrance-observer/issues/8)\n\n> **Why**: This creates a new product offering (entrance camera + GPU) with minimal development effort, while establishing a foundation for future iterations on more cost-effective and energy-efficient devices (ESP32 cam, Raspberry Pi).\n\n## Expectations from AI Accelerator\n\n- Refine product value proposition and messaging\n- Improve business model (pricing strategy, GTM approach, unit economics)\n- Technical guidance for AI implementation (addressing the challenges outlined above)\n- Intellectual property support (logo design, trademark registration)\n- Preparation for investor due diligence\n- Community engagement and networking opportunities\n\n<iframe

And to keep data up to date we would need to do this over and over in a loop, which would add too much load on Keskkonnaagentuur servers\n\n- (Old) [API forecast](https://www.ilmateenistus.ee/ilma_andmed/xml/forecast.php?lang=eng) for Estonia works, but it has some issues too\n\n  - granularity is too broad - it is split into day and night, instead of hourly\n  - its forecasts only 4 days\n  - its tied to key regions, not coordinates\n  - regions are forecasted only for 1 day ahead, the rest is considered the same for all regions\n  - it does not always have wind speed property, even though text description has one\n\n- Climate data time series API shows past data, but not future forecast.\n  https://keskkonnaandmed.envir.ee/f_kliima_tund?aasta=eq.2024&kuu=eq.11&paev=lt.30 seems the best to retrieve past data per meteo station\n  - We can still use it to correlate weather affecting beehives post-factum though. But our focus in hackathon is to prevent beehive collapse due to storms by alarming a beekeeper.\n\n### Suggestions\n\n- Implement REST APIs of weather prediction with filtering capabilities based on coordinates.\n- Enable lightweight real-time data streams via web sockets or webhooks.\n\n## Progress Updates\n\n### Friday\n\n- Developed an ad-hoc feature prototype.\n- Created a **React app** prototype by Alonso:\n  - [Live Demo](https://bee-app-zeta.vercel.app/)\n  - [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/alonsosolisg/bee-app)\n- Registered new internal graphql API `weatherEstonia` query type and we used https://www.ilmateenistus.ee/ilma_andmed/xml/forecast.php?lang=eng XML data, which was converted to JSON.\n  - We had to find closes meteostation given lat/long coordinates, which was tricky\n    ![](img/Screenshot%202024-11-30%20at%2003.25.22.png)\n    ![](img/Screenshot%202024-11-30%20at%2003.23.05.png)\n    ![](img/Screenshot%202024-11-30%20at%2017.30.58.png)![](img/Screenshot%202024-11-30%20at%2003.50.42.png)\n\n## Saturday progress\n\n- We had to re-write API handling, because data nesting was\n  `day -> data` instead of `data -> time` which we needed for charts in UI to plot the data\n\n  https://github.com/Gratheon/weather/blob/main/app/resolvers.js#L19\n\n- We decided to show both the react app prototype that will have full vision of what we intend to do, as well as mention that we have production ready service using real API\n\n![](img/Screenshot%202024-11-30%20at%2011.27.14.png)\n\n- later we found another API https://ilmmicroservice.envir.ee/api_doc/#api-Forecasts-GetV1ForecastsModelforecastbylocation that could be used for weather data. Although further discussion with mentors proved that this is somewhat private API that may change and using XML is best for now\n- We were practicing the pitch scenario and decided to show both the react app prototype to show off what is the vision as well as show that we did integrate real API into existing Gratheon web-app and weather microservice\n- We considered questions on marketing and sales (like that we target semi-professional beekeepers)\n- We've updated the UI prototype to have better highlighting of the danger zones\n- For the pitch, we configured twilio API to send SMS to all of the mentors/judges to effectively share our demo\n\n## Alert use case\n\n- Gratheon web-app monitors beekeepers apiaries and dangerous weather that can affect bees\n- When there is a storm or a heatwave approaching the apiary, web-app generates an alert\n- If user has entered the phone in the user profile and allowed us to contact him over the phone, we send an SMS\n- User (beekeeper) receives an SMS alert on the phone with a URL to relevant apiary\n- User opens apiary view, sees there is an alert details about high temperature (heat wave coming) or a high wind, when exactly it is expected and how dangerous it is\n- User reads an advice of what he needs to do, for example in case of storm - limit hive entrance, tie together hive with a rope\n\n![](img/Screenshot%202024-11-30%20at%2014.15.00.png)\n\n## Data correlation use-case\n\nIdea is to not only collect weather data when user opens the view or not only to predict data in advance, but also collect past weather information for specific apiary location.\n\nThis is needed so that beekeeper or AI model could correlate weather effects affecting the bees. For example, if there was 2 weeks of daily rain, then bees may be grounded and lose resources (pollen, nectar) which will be seen on hive weight graph too\n\n## Result\n\nWe competed with 15 other teams and we did not win. Teams presented various solutions, winners suggested solutions with ESG and general data analysis that judges likely found to best fit judgement criterias and what Keskkonnaagentuur needed.\n\nWe had hands-on work on SMS alerting channels, weather APIs and more attractive UI for charts that will not go to waste. We shared the awareness of the product and did some networking."},{"id":"/2024/11/22/ üéí PurposeTech Early traction webinar","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2024/11/22/ üéí PurposeTech Early traction webinar","editUrl":"https://github.com/gratheon/website/tree/main/blog/2024-11-22 üéí PurposeTech Early traction webinar.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-11-22 üéí PurposeTech Early traction webinar.md","title":" üéí PurposeTech Early traction webinar","description":"Go to market strategy","date":"2024-11-22T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":0.75,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":" üõ†Ô∏è Andmetorm hackathon","permalink":"/blog/2024/11/29/ üõ†Ô∏è Andmetorm hackathon"},"nextItem":{"title":" üéí Attended Practical startup strategy webinar","permalink":"/blog/2024/11/19/ üéí Attended Practical startup strategy webinar"}},"content":"![](img/Screenshot%202024-11-22%20at%2017.14.25.png)\n\n<!--truncate-->\n\n![](img/Screenshot%202024-11-22%20at%2017.14.17.png)\n\n\n\n![](img/Screenshot%202024-11-22%20at%2017.05.27.png)\n![](img/Screenshot%202024-11-22%20at%2017.06.11.png)\n\n\n![](img/Screenshot%202024-11-22%20at%2017.14.33.png)\n\n![](img/Screenshot%202024-11-22%20at%2017.14.38.png)\n\n![](img/Screenshot%202024-11-22%20at%2017.14.42.png)\n\n![](img/Screenshot%202024-11-22%20at%2017.14.47.png)\n\n![](img/Screenshot%202024-11-22%20at%2017.16.48.png)\n\n\n## Go to market strategy\n- paid vs unpaid\n- events & scalability\n- channels\n- willingness to pay\n\n![](img/Screenshot%202024-11-22%20at%2017.25.21.png)\n\n\n## Pre-seed traction types\n- Customer Interest\n\t- Letter of intent\n\t- newsletter to measure engagement\n- Marketing efficiency\n\t- virality\n\t- conversion\n- Product engagement (if you have it)\n\t- installs\n\t- signups\n\t- retention\n- Initial revenues (if you can)\n\t- pilots\n\t- subscription (stripe?)\n- Commitment from other investors\n\t- professional investors in the field (ex.

2022\n\nFarming crops are inefficiently pollinated. This happens because beehives are currently positioned randomly, however beekeeper decides to. Beekeepers do not know where and why to place beehives. Bees are key to¬†**natural pollination**, which increases¬†**crop yields**, aiding in food supply, reducing the need in deforestation.¬†****Farmers can inadvertently kill bees with pesticides.\n\n**Solution**\n\nWe're improving¬†**environment overview**¬†**for the beekeepers**.\n\nBy analyzing pollination coverage from satellite, beehives can be positioned more¬†**efficiently**.\n\nThanks to our app, farmers can get better yields, beekeepers get more honey and healthy bees and bees get more nectar or pollen diversity.\n\nDiverse pollen improves bee's health as well as taste of the honey. Bees also do not need to compete with each other as much over resources. Separate hive positioning reduces the risk of diseases.\n\nIn general,¬†[Gratheon](https://gratheon.com/)¬†helps beekeepers with observability and automation so that they could be more efficient and their colonies would stay healthy. We provide app and integrate hardware so that computer vision could alert a beekeeper in case of danger. Our long-term vision is autonomous robotic beehive.\n\n**Pollen map feature ideation**\n\n1. Given a satellite image of the apiary with 5 km radius (max flight range of a bee), run AI predictions to detect which¬†**types**¬†of trees and field crops are growing around the apiary and its¬†**square area (m2)**.\n![](img/image1.png)\n\nCrop classification, image and feature by EOS data analytics as a goal\n\n2. Given detected pollination sources, suggest to beekeeper how to optimally place bees to optimize for max nectar flow or max pollen diversity. This is also important given that crops may bloom at different time. Coupled with real-time pollination activity data at individual beehives, beekeeper can make informed decisions\n\n![](img/image2.png)\n\nHive placement optimization, image and feature by [beehero.io](http://beehero.io)\n\nNote that this feature targets beekeepers that are able to¬†**move beehives**¬†or city planners that want to optimally position autonomous beehives in the city. For static apiaries we would¬†_only_¬†provide what type of nectar/honey you can expect, so that you would know at which time specific nectar (ex. buckwheat) is harvested as well as predict the amount of honey depending on the plant's nectar secretion\n\n**Product Design Mockup**\n\nWe started with how we want user to interact with the map to receive interested data\n\n- crop types\n- ratios of crops within pollinateable area\n- blooming time\n- plant nectar production (kg/ha)\n\n## EU space technologies\n\nWe are using Sentinel 2 L1C data, RGB layer to get base information about fields\n\nWe are then running segmentation on an image to detect fields\n\nThen we run classification of detected fields to understand which crop we are dealing with. As we know time of the image, we can use it to match blooming time.\n\nThen we calculate the square area of the field\n\nThen we calculate the ratio of all field types within 5km vicinity and report this to the user (beekeeper)\n\nBeekeeper can move the location of the beehive, which will result in recalculation of percentages\n\nBeekeeper can also see how much bees from different hives intersect\n\n# Team\n\n[Artjom Kurapov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kurapov/)¬†- ¬†software engineer\n\n[Aleksei Boris](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alekseiboris/)¬†- bizdev / legal / ops\n\n[Natalia Kinash](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nataliia-kinash/)¬†- machine learning engineer, applied mathematics\n\n[Reinis Indans](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAACcYIOABh-CstsU-a3j6keX8AEZKUSY5El8&keywords=Reinis%20Indans&origin=ENTITY_SEARCH_HOME_HISTORY&sid=uqZ)¬†- GIS / fullstack engineer\n\n[Untitled](https://www.notion.so/1f6cefe4cafd43ef8a2f6ba21e684554?pvs=21)\n\n## Design mockup\n\n![](img/Screenshot%202023-11-04%20at%2008.58.03.png)\n\nApiary view with single hive map\n\n![](img/Screenshot%202023-11-04%20at%2009.24.44.png)\nBlooming time view\n\n## System design\n\n![](img/Screenshot%202023-11-04%20at%2009.15.25.png)\n\nService component diagram\n\nInitial idea was that, given coordinates X,Y of the apiary, we make request to copernicus servers to receive RGB visible spectrum data. Then we pass result png image to a trained ML model that will do segmentation of fields and classification of them. We then wanted to store inference results to DB to have caching in place in case user visits same page.\n\n**Machine learning and SATELLITE DATA USED**\n\nWe trained two separate models during development.\n\nWe tried first¬†[a light-weight version](https://universe.roboflow.com/gratheon/crop-fields/model/2)¬†which could do segmentation of ¬†fields without actual classification. We did not end up using it as we wanted actual field types and it was trained on pre-existing dataset that was not related to Copernicus although it would be the fastest to integrate\n\nSecond model was more complex. We exported map of Estonia without cloud coverage (for 13 june 2023) from Copernicus Open Data Hub in multispectral .dim format which includes all layers (infrered etc), then we processed it in QGIS. We normalized resolution to be 20m.\n\nFor training a model we took polygon data from Estonian registries - PRIA (crop fields registry) and Maaamet (forests and buildings). Then we unified these layers, cleaned classes (out of original 300 classes we got 25 classes). To prepare dataset, for every class we picked training (300) and validation(50) instances. We used random forest model.\n\n![](img/qgis.jpeg)\n\nQGis interface\n\nAs a result, model produces an image where for every pixel we have a class prediction. This allows us to run inference in countries/regions that do not have digital field/crop mapping data available. This also allows us to easily calculate class ratios using simple per-pixel sumation.\n\nFor inference we use sentinel-2-l2a and process API\n\n\n\nVisualization of trained fie![](img/estonia-fields.png)ld classification near Tallinn, Estonia (on top)\n\n**Result app**\n\nWe have a web-app deployed and available for the customers.\n\nWe make request to copernicus server to get sentinel-2-l2a image for specific location +- 4 km (bee flight range) and provide a list of classes we can run inference on\n\nTo access it, you need to:\n\n- register in the app -¬†[https://app.gratheon.com/account/register](https://app.gratheon.com/account/register)\n- create new apiary -¬†[https://app.gratheon.com/apiaries/create](https://app.gratheon.com/apiaries/create)\n- go into apiary view, drag the marker and click \"Analyze crops\" -¬†[https://app.gratheon.com/apiaries/edit/2](https://app.gratheon.com/apiaries/edit/2)\n\n**Source code**\n\n- ML training dataset -¬†[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Gh4DXqaDFF1r3lsgxQlo2HREPjo6xlRK?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Gh4DXqaDFF1r3lsgxQlo2HREPjo6xlRK?usp=sharing)\n- Backend & ML code -¬†[https://github.com/Gratheon/satellite-pollination-map](https://github.com/Gratheon/satellite-pollination-map)\n- Frontend recent changes related to hackathon -¬†[https://github.com/Gratheon/web-app/commits/main](https://github.com/Gratheon/web-app/commits/main)\n\n**Limitations & future work**\n\n- We could connect beekeepers with farmers to prevent pesticide exposure affecting bees during blooming time\n- ML model needs more work on precision. We used fixed date for dataset, so instead we could use historical data to train models with more precise blooming time (say every 2 weeks, april-june)\n- We did not reach deploying model into production within hackathon timeframe.\n- We did not reach integrating correct pollination times and nectar flow rate for classes that we intend to detect\n\n\n![](img/399275275_750135310479095_4769808596453906481_n.jpg)\n\n![](img/garage48.jpg)![](img/400149287_750137250478901_8295912363465611030_n.jpg)![](img/400167050_750134100479216_293610792512181331_n.jpg)\n\n![](img/400175763_750137117145581_2512030399661623454_n.jpg)\n\n\n[https://garage48.org/events/6th-cassini-hackathon](https://garage48.org/events/6th-cassini-hackathon) [https://www.cassini.eu/hackathons/estonia?mtm_campaign=6CHLOEE](https://www.cassini.eu/hackathons/estonia?mtm_campaign=6CHLOEE)\n\nGratheon project registered: [https://taikai.network/cassinihackathons/hackathons/intdev-humaid/projects/cloewercb02zevm01kqo4xlr7/idea](https://taikai.network/cassinihackathons/hackathons/intdev-humaid/projects/cloewercb02zevm01kqo4xlr7/idea)\n\nAPIs to be used:\n\n[https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/analyse/apis](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/analyse/apis)\n\n[https://www.cassini.eu/hackathons/tools](https://www.cassini.eu/hackathons/tools)\n\n\n### **6.

Healthy bees and well-pollinated crops not only benefit the environment but also strengthen the capacity of natural systems to withstand the challenges posed by climate change.\n\nChatGPT\n\n[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQsXF8weZdAUXo3jlVPVdMTdLGtG1G2xi_4cMkuNjrTd4Y--OZBLYyW0yOTGC0ilHfimFBAo-mM1VRG/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQsXF8weZdAUXo3jlVPVdMTdLGtG1G2xi_4cMkuNjrTd4Y--OZBLYyW0yOTGC0ilHfimFBAo-mM1VRG/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000)\n\nHi. My name is Artjom and I represent **Gratheon**. Our mission is to [Company Mission](https://www.notion.so/Company-Mission-e052619834d4474793e15f95dba6dd04?pvs=21). I‚Äôm a software engineer and a beekeeper. A bee colony is a super-organism like a city while individual bees are cute and fluffy. I like both aspects of having such a complex pet.\n\n## Hook\n\nTo understand the bee problems, lets think of a situation when humanity is infected with headcrabs and the only help can come from aliens that visit earth every 100 years and to count crab, they kills 3% of the population and temporarily cures humans. That is the state of modern beekeeping with lots of manual inspections.\n\n## Solution\n\nOur solution is a web app that can detect bees, cells, wasps these headcrabs so that all of your bees stay healthy and alive. You take a photo of a frame or you place phone at the beehive entrance to count bees. Then this image or video is analyzed with AI and you get a report on you beehive condition. Next steps is to automate this by building a robot that would send data automatically and would not need to open the hive and stress the bees.\n\n## Competition\n\nAlthough there are solutions that target same problems, they focus only on commercial beekeepers, they don‚Äôt provide sufficient information.\n\n## Market\n\nOur target audience is hobby beekeepers who wants to get lots of information and advice with minimal intervention using user-friendly machienery. Early adopters would be a tech-enthusiasts and startup companies with shared values.\n\nWorld wide there are around 100M bee colonies. And in Europe about 620k beekeepers.\n\n## Team\n\nOur team is growing, we are experienced team of software engineers, with a startup background in API, AI, video processing and cloud. We are looking for more AI and robotics help.\n\n## Call to action\n\nWe are looking for a 630k investment to have runway for 18 months for a team of 4. And we plan to build an MVP for the entrance counter and build a robotic nest as PoC.\n\nYou can contact us at **[pilot@gratheon.com](mailto:pilot@gratheon.com)**"},{"id":"/2023/10/27/ üõ†Ô∏è Winner in API World + AI DevWorld Hackaton","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/10/27/ üõ†Ô∏è Winner in API World + AI DevWorld Hackaton","editUrl":"https://github.com/gratheon/website/tree/main/blog/2023-10-27 üõ†Ô∏è Winner in API World + AI DevWorld Hackaton.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-10-27 üõ†Ô∏è Winner in API World + AI DevWorld Hackaton.md","title":" üõ†Ô∏è Winner in API World + AI DevWorld Hackaton","description":"Participated in API World conference (USA) and AI DevWorld Hackaton","date":"2023-10-27T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":0.075,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":" üõ†Ô∏è Climathon hackathon","permalink":"/blog/2023/10/28/ üõ†Ô∏è Climathon hackathon"},"nextItem":{"title":" üéí Tehnopol tech startup bootcamp","permalink":"/blog/2023/10/10/ üéí Tehnopol tech startup bootcamp"}},"content":"Participated in API World conference (USA) and AI DevWorld Hackaton\n\nhttps://api-world-hackathon-2023.devpost.com/project-gallery\n\nTraction by judges: [https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7123696357936132098/](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7123696357936132098/)"},{"id":"/2023/10/10/ üéí Tehnopol tech startup bootcamp","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/10/10/ üéí Tehnopol tech startup bootcamp","editUrl":"https://github.com/gratheon/website/tree/main/blog/2023-10-10 üéí Tehnopol tech startup bootcamp.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-10-10 üéí Tehnopol tech startup bootcamp.md","title":" üéí Tehnopol tech startup bootcamp","description":"Participated in 3-day startup bootcamp organized by Tehnopol","date":"2023-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":0.05,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":" üõ†Ô∏è Winner in API World + AI DevWorld Hackaton","permalink":"/blog/2023/10/27/ üõ†Ô∏è Winner in API World + AI DevWorld Hackaton"},"nextItem":{"title":" üí∂ Pitched to Picus Capital","permalink":"/blog/2023/01/12/ üí∂ Pitched to Picus Capital"}},"content":"Participated in 3-day startup bootcamp organized by Tehnopol\nhttps://www.tehnopol.ee/sundmused/tech-startup-bootcamp-3-paeva-x-online-x-vene-keeles/\n\n![](img/71426-230924093200.jpg)"},{"id":"/2023/01/12/ üí∂ Pitched to Picus Capital","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2023/01/12/ üí∂ Pitched to Picus Capital","editUrl":"https://github.com/gratheon/website/tree/main/blog/2023-01-12 üí∂ Pitched to Picus Capital.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-01-12 üí∂ Pitched to Picus Capital.md","title":" üí∂ Pitched to Picus Capital","description":"Pitched a project to German VC fund.","date":"2023-01-12T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":0.135,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":" üéí Tehnopol tech startup bootcamp","permalink":"/blog/2023/10/10/ üéí Tehnopol tech startup bootcamp"}},"content":"Pitched a project to German VC fund.\nGot questions were about robotics\nDid not have any further follow-up, likely because we are very early in development\n\nhttps://www.picuscap.com/"}]}}
